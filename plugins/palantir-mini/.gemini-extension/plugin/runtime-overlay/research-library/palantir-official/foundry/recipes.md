# Recipes \[Sunset]

:::callout{theme="warning" title="Sunset"}
Recipes is in the [sunset](/docs/foundry/platform-overview/development-life-cycle/) phase of development and will be deprecated at a future date. Full support remains available. We recommend migrating your workflows to other applications and tools to serve your use case purposes:

* [Automations:](/docs/foundry/automate/overview/) Create automations that run on top of your data and track individual searches and objects, triggering notifications or other actions when certain conditions are met. Recipe users may be particularly interested in [time series alerting automations](/docs/foundry/time-series/alerting-overview/).
* [Foundry Rules:](/docs/foundry/foundry-rules/overview/) Create logic-based rules to apply to datasets, objects, and time series that trigger alerts when certain conditions are met.
* [Monitoring views:](/docs/foundry/monitoring-views/overview/) Use monitoring views to view metric updates of Foundry resources, including datasets, agents, schedules, objects, and link types.
* [Workshop:](/docs/foundry/workshop/overview/) Build an alert inbox or other notification workflow to configure actions that will trigger when certain conditions are met.

Contact Palantir Support if you have questions regarding the appropriate workflows to implement for your monitoring use case.
:::

Recipes enables users to monitor for conditions of interest, automatically send notifications through Foundry or email to other users, and deliver a preview of additional context related to the conditions of interest. Recipes spans various apps within Foundry including [Dataset Preview](/docs/foundry/dataset-preview/overview/) and [Reports](/docs/foundry/reports/overview/).

## Example use

Recipes can be used to monitor and react to a variety of situations, including the following examples:

* Notify a user when inventory of any products drops below 100.
* Send out a report or report link every Tuesday at 9 a.m.
* If a sensor ever reaches a certain threshold in Quiver, email a specified group of people.

## Considerations

Recipes is intended to be used when data is healthy to assist users monitor conditions or items of interest. Recipes is not designed to check whether data meets expectations (in terms of volume, quality, and so on). For these cases, we recommend using [Data Health](/docs/foundry/health-checks/overview/).

Recipes should never be used as a critical alerting system for safety. Although Recipes is effective in terms of performance, it was not designed as a low-latency, high dependency system. Recipes should be viewed as a way to track conditions of interest rather than used as a critical alerting system.

Recipes should not be used as the sole source of data for users through previews and exports. It is intended to be a reminder or link back to Foundry when something of interest occurs, where you can see the full picture of the data.
