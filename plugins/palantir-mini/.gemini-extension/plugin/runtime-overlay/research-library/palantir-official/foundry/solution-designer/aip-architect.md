# AIP Architect

AIP Architect brings LLM-powered capabilities to Solution Designer, enabling you to turn a set of workflow requirements into a step-by-step implementation plan for building a solution with the Palantir platform. You can use Solution Designer to explore options, plan workflows, and accelerate the building process with AIP Architect as an AI guide.

![Example workflow graph for AIP Architect](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-workflow-graph-example.png)

If you can provide AIP Architect with a description of what you want to accomplish with the platform - such as the problem, any constraints or requirements, or even thoughts on a desired solution or output - then AIP Architect will create an implementation plan for you in the form of a *workflow graph*. Drawing on a library of components and implementation patterns, an AIP Architect workflow graph describes the pieces of the workflow and how they fit together as a solution architecture, giving you a plan for how to build effectively in the platform.

## Get started with AIP Architect

There are several ways to use AIP Architect as part of Solution Designer.

From the initial Solution Designer home page, you can select **Start planning** to open the [AIP Architect wizard](#aip-architect-wizard).

!["Start planning" button accessible from home screen of Solution Designer.](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-start-planning.png)

Or, from a new Solution Designer diagram, select **Start planning** to launch the [AIP Architect wizard](#aip-architect-wizard).

!["Start planning" button accessible from empty new diagram of Solution Designer.](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-start-planning-new-diagram.png)

Alternatively, from an existing Solution Designer diagram, you can select the **Concept** icon in the top toolbar to add an AIP Architect [concept node](#concept-nodes) and use that as a starting point to auto-generate an implementation plan, skipping the AIP Architect wizard.

## AIP Architect wizard

After opening the AIP Architect wizard, you will be guided through several prompts to provide information to AIP Architect, such as:

* What you are trying to build (that is, the end product or artifact)
* The source of data for this workflow
* How you'd like to build the workflow (specifically, how much code you would like to use)

### Describe the end product or artifact for your workflow

The first step in the AIP Architect wizard is to provide information about what you are trying to build. This could be a dataset, an application, a document, a dashboard, or something else.

After selecting the end product or artifact of your workflow, you will be prompted to describe any workflow requirements you might have; in this space, summarize the workflow that you have in mind.

For example, assume you want to build an application to schedule nurse shifts in a hospital. The screenshot below shows the wizard after entering a prompt containing these workflow requirements.

![AIP Architect wizard after providing workflow requirements prompt](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-workflow-requirements.png)

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
AIP Architect uses the workflow summary you provide to generate suggestions when constructing your solution design graph. You can modify your summary later in the process in order to update these suggestions.
:::

Your workflow prompt could be something simple, as in the prompt used in the nurse shift scheduling example:

> I want to build an application that schedules shifts for nurses in a hospital. I want to optimize these schedules based on nurse preferences and forecasted demand.

You can also provide a more detailed set of workflow requirements to AIP Architect, such as the following prompt:

> I work at a manufacturing company and we need to generate demand forecasts across the entire SKU base. I need to determine the best strategy for each SKU, leveraging both internal data, such as historical sales and inventory, and external data, such as weather patterns.
>
> Beyond just a forward-looking forecast, I also want to look at "what-if" simulations for relevant inputs. I want to use natural-language prompts, such as "what if the weather is colder than expected next month?" or "what if I increase prices by 10%?". Then, I want to orchestrate the parameter changes to perform the simulation.

> Key Features:
>
> * Live demand simulation: Leverage model outputs, such as coefficients of correlation or confidence intervals to provide executives and planners with an easy-to-use simulation cockpit.
> * Business-user-focused interface: Help non-technical business experts drive model iteration and validation against real data using their business experience.
> * Highly-configurable modeling: Implement forecasts that make sense for the business at a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly cadence across customers, SKUs and product lines.

### Describe the source data for the workflow

After providing the initial workflow information to AIP Architect, the AIP Architect wizard will ask you about the data that will be powering this workflow. First, you will be prompted to select the source of the data for this workflow. Options include:

* External data source/system
* Manual upload
* Existing Foundry data
* User input data (for example, from a user-submitted form)

Then, you can provide information about how often the data is updated, the data scale, and any special properties about the data (whether the data is geospatial, time series, media, and so on). This information helps AIP Architect suggest the most appropriate platform applications to execute the workflow and deliver the desired outcome or output.

### Describe how you want to build the workflow

Finally, AIP Architect asks how you would prefer to build your Workflow - the options here are "no code" (point-and-click), "low code" (writing basic functions), and "pro code" (working primarily in a code editor). Based on your response to this question, AIP Architect will select platform applications that fit the amount of code you want to use when building a workflow. After making your selection, select **Generate workflow graph** to create your workflow graph.

## Plan your workflow

After your workflow graph has been generated, you will see an abstract representation of your workflow as a series of "concept nodes" connected by arrows. Each concept node represents a general part of the target workflow, such as data sourcing, data processing, Ontology, or application building.

![Example empty workflow graph for nurse scheduling](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-workflow-graph-empty.png)

### Concept nodes

These concept nodes serve as a reference for the implementation of your workflow. To instruct AIP Architect to generate a more detailed workflow implementation, select a concept node (other than than the Ontology node, which is discussed below) and choose the **Select implementation** dropdown. AIP Architect will suggest potential implementation plans for your workflow; you can preview an implementation plan on your graph, along with AI-generated context, before adding it to your workflow graph by selecting **Insert into graph**.

![Select implementation menu for workflow graph](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-select-implementation.png)

You can add implementation plans to all of the non-Ontology concept nodes; AIP Architect will automatically connect nodes together based on the provided context. You can also add additional concept nodes, such as an analytics or modeling node, to your workflow (and thereby generate additional implementation plans) by selecting the **Concept** icon in the top toolbar.

![Add additional concept node](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-add-additional-concept-node.png)

Plans generated by AIP Architect can be modified by users. AIP Architect will take any changes made by users into account when generating implementations for other parts of the workflow.

### Ontology node

The Ontology node differs from other concept nodes in that the **Select implementation** dropdown is replaced by a **Generate data model** dropdown. The **Generate data model** dropdown provides a user-editable prompt where you can describe what you want your Ontology model to look like; based on this prompt, AIP Architect will generate a set of object types, object type properties, and link types on the graph.

![Ontology node after selecting generate data model](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-ontology-node.png)

## Build your planned workflow

After generating a workflow plan, you can begin to actually build the workflow with AIP Architect. The left-hand AIP Architect sidebar displays an overview of your workflow’s implementation plan, automatically generated based on the workflow graph.

![Implementation plan for example workflow graph](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-workflow-graph-implementation-plan.png)

AIP Architect will guide you through the process of creating your workflow using the Walkthrough helper. To begin, select **Save and Start Building**.

At this point, an AIP Architect Walkthrough panel will appear to provide you with a step-by-step guide through the actual implementation process. You can skip to any part of the walkthrough, or navigate the steps in order with the **Next** and **Previous** navigation buttons at the top.

![AIP Architect Walkthrough panel](/docs/resources/foundry/solution-designer/aip-architect-walkthrough-panel.png)

From here, you can use the indicated applications to build an operational workflow.
