# Functions on Objects

## Typescript

### Assign alerts to analysts in a round-robin fashion

How do I assign a list of objects to another group of objects in a round-robin fashion using Typescript?

This code defines an Ontology edit function that assigns alerts to analysts in a round-robin fashion. It iterates through the alerts and assigns them to analysts by their employee ID, looping back to the first analyst when all analysts have been assigned an alert.

```typescript
@OntologyEditFunction()
@Edits(Alert)
    public async alertAssignment(alerts: Alert[]>): Promise<void>{
        const analysts = Objects.search().analyst.all();
        const numAnalysts = analysts.length;
        if(numAnalysts === 0){
            return
        }
        let analystIndex = 0;
        for(const alert of alerts)
        {
            const employeeId = analysts.at(analystIndex)!.employeeId;
            alert.assignedTo = employeeId;
            analystIndex += 1;
            if (analystIndex === numAnalysts){
                analystIndex = 0;
            }
        }
        
    }
```

### Get days between timestamps

How do I calculate the number of days between two timestamps in Typescript?

This code defines a function that takes two Timestamp objects as input and returns the number of days between them as an Integer.

```typescript
import { Function, Integer, Timestamp} from "@foundry/functions-api";


@Function()
    public getDaysBetweenTimestamp(date1: Timestamp, date2: Timestamp): Integer{
            return Math.floor((Math.abs((date1.getTime()-date2.getTime())) / (1000 * 3600 * 24)));
    }
```
