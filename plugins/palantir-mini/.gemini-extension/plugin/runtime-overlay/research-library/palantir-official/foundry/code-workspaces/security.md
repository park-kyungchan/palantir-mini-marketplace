# Security

Code Workspaces ensures that Foundry’s security and permissions model is applied to the third-party IDEs connected to Foundry. This layer of security on top of the third-party applications served by Code Workspaces provides a number of benefits:

* Data loaded in Code Workspaces is tracked by Foundry. Data downloads and uploads are restricted in Code Workspaces other than [methods governed by Foundry’s data governance and access controls](/docs/foundry/code-workspaces/troubleshooting/#file-download-or-upload-errors).
* Every request to Code Workspaces is validated against Foundry’s governance framework. This means that if a user’s access to a Code Workspace is revoked, or access to the security markings of any data imported in the workspace, that user will immediately lose access to the application.
* Data produced from Code Workspaces is tracked by Foundry, so access to output data will be restricted if a user loses access to data which may have been used to produce the output data.
* Users are fully isolated. Each user opening a given Jupyter® or RStudio® Code Workspace will get their own isolated environment.
* R and Python packages can only be loaded from Foundry Artifacts channels backing the repository, which enables control over the Conda, PyPI, or CRAN packages that can be used in a specific Code Workspace.
* External API calls can only be made to URLs configured as Network Policies which have been added to the Code Workspace.

## Restricted outputs mode

Restricted outputs mode provides enhanced safeguards when working with sensitive data. Restricted outputs mode is a "read-only" mode that restricts write operations and external source connections to ensure that data cannot be exported from the code workspace. In particular, it allows you to load [restricted views](/docs/foundry/code-workspaces/data/#restricted-views) into a workspace.

When enabled, restricted outputs mode:

* **Prevents write operations** to all Foundry outputs, including datasets, models, and tables.
* **Disables telemetry collection and logs**, as well as data checkpoint uploads, while still preserving [code checkpoints](/docs/foundry/code-workspaces/getting-started/#code-checkpoints).
* **Disables network policies and sources** that have been added to the workspace. These resources remain in the workspace but are inactivated while in restricted outputs mode.

As described in the documentation on [code checkpoints](/docs/foundry/code-workspaces/getting-started/#code-checkpoints), it is your responsibility to ensure that code files you write while in restricted outputs mode do not contain data.

To enable or disable restricted outputs mode:

1. Open the **Settings** side panel in your code workspace.
2. Locate the **Restricted outputs mode** toggle.
3. Toggle the setting on or off as needed.
4. Save your changes and restart your workspace when prompted.

After enabling restricted outputs mode, your workspace will prompt you to restart. Your setting will persist across future workspace restarts until you explicitly disable it.
