# Set up a source

A Foundry source represents a connection between Foundry and an external system. Some example Foundry source types include a Postgres database, an S3 bucket, a filesystem on a Linux server, an SAP instance, or a REST API over the Internet.

At a high level, below are the steps required to connect a source to Foundry. Note that Step 1 through Step 3 may require you to change or validate configurations within your existing architecture:

1. [Ensure there is a valid network connection](#configure-network-access) between the source and Foundry.
2. [Provision valid credentials](#provision-credentials) for Foundry to authenticate against the source.
3. If the source will be executing compute on an [agent worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#agent-worker), then ensure the agent has the [appropriate drivers](#optional-add-jdbc-drivers) to access the external system.
4. Finally, [create the source in Data Connection](#create-the-source-in-data-connection).

Once you have this source connection established, you can configure [syncs](/docs/foundry/data-connection/set-up-sync/) to bring specific sets of data into Foundry. Syncs can be entirely configured through the Data Connection UI, so the source setup is the final task that may require configurations to be updated in your organization's environment before you can access your data within Foundry.

## Configure network access

To connect Foundry to an external system, first validate network paths:

* External systems hosted in the same network as and accepting inbound connections from Foundry requires a single valid network connection from Foundry to the external system. For cloud-hosted instances of Foundry, this is typically the case for cloud-based systems or SaaS services.
* External systems hosted in a separate network from Foundry must use an [agent](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#agents) with two valid network paths: (1) from the agent host to the external system and (2) from the agent host to Foundry. For cloud-hosted instances of Foundry, a separate network usually means an on-premise network.

### (Optional) Set up an agent and configure agent connectivity

You will need to [set up an agent](/docs/foundry/data-connection/set-up-agent/) if the external system you are connecting to is hosted on a separate network from Foundry's network.

If you decide to use a [Foundry worker source with agent proxy policies](/docs/foundry/data-connection/architecture/#foundry-worker-with-agent-proxy-policy), the agent will be used as a networking proxy only and the compute will happen in Foundry. If you decide to use an [agent worker source](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#agent-worker), the agent will serve both as networking proxy and a compute engine.

Ensure there is a connection between an agent set up within your network and the external system. The agent acts as a single point of validated entry to Foundry from your network and will handle the process of reading and sending data on to the Foundry instance. For each new system, you will only need to confirm there is a valid connection between the agent and the new system.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
You will not need to establish direct network egress from the external system to Foundry, as traffic only flows from the agent to Foundry and from the agent to the external system. [Learn more about the architecture of data connection.](/docs/foundry/data-connection/architecture/)
:::

The steps required to establish this connection will vary depending on your organizational network settings. Regardless of your specific setup, the goal is for the agent to have the ability to connect to the external system. This could involve the configuration of egress settings on the agent host, ingress settings on the external system, firewall rules across the network, proxy settings on the agent, adding source system [certificates](/docs/foundry/data-connection/agent-configuration-reference/#certificates) to the agent truststore, and so on.

If you need to configure proxy settings for the agent to reach the external system, you can do this [through Data Connection](/docs/foundry/data-connection/agent-configuration-reference/#proxy-configuration).

### Configure a network policy

:::callout{theme="warning"}
You must have the `Information security officer` role on your [enrollment](/docs/foundry/administration/enrollments-and-organizations/) to configure network egress. If you do not have permissions to configure egress, contact your Palantir administrator to request access.

You can find the `Information security officer` role in the **Enrollment permissions** section of [Control Panel](/docs/foundry/administration/control-panel/). A user must have the `Enrollment administrator` role to view this section.
:::

[Foundry worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#foundry-worker) sources additionally require network egress policies to route the traffic.

To configure a network policy, navigate to the **Network egress** section in Control Panel. Pick a [direct connection policy](/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/#direct-connection-egress-policies) if the external system you are connecting to is hosted in the same network than Foundry. Pick an [agent proxy egress policy](/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/#agent-proxy-egress-policies) if the source you are connecting to is in a separate network from Foundry.

If you are unable to view the **Network egress** section, contact your Palantir administrator to set up the network policy.

![The dialog to create a new network egress policy in Control Panel](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/create-network-policy.png)

## Provision credentials

For most cases, Foundry will require authorized credentials (such as a username and password) to access external systems. We recommend using a dedicated service account with credentials scoped specifically for the required access in Foundry.

Provision a service account for the source following any internal guidelines and processes that your organization has for establishing service accounts. Note the credentials before proceeding to the next step.

## Create the source in Data Connection

Once the above steps are done, you can proceed with creating the source in Data Connection:

* After logging in, navigate to **Data Connection** using the [sidebar](/docs/foundry/getting-started/orientation-and-nav/).
* Select the **Sources** tab.
* Select **New source** in the top-right.
* Select the [source type](/docs/foundry/data-integration/source-type-overview/) corresponding to your data source.
* Select [Foundry worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#foundry-worker) or [agent worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#agent-worker), then select **Continue** in the bottom right.

### Save the source in a Project

Next, name your source and choose a [Project](/docs/foundry/compass/move-and-share-resources/) to place it in. We generally recommend creating a new Project for each source, as this provides the most natural way to permission datasets derived from this source.

You can read more about [source permission best practices](/docs/foundry/data-connection/permissions/#source-best-practices) or consult the [full guidance for how to structure data pipelines end-to-end in Foundry](/docs/foundry/building-pipelines/recommended-project-structure/).

Select **Create source and continue** in the bottom-right.

### Choose your network policy \[Foundry worker]

On the next setup page, select the network policy you [configured earlier](#configure-a-network-policy) by choosing **Use existing policy** and searching for the policy name.

![The Network Connectivity setup page in Data Connection.](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/use-existing-policy.png)

![Select an available network policy to use.](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/select-network-policy.png)

### Configure source

Add details about how to connect to your source. These will depend on the [source type](/docs/foundry/data-integration/source-type-overview/) you are using and typically consist of basic credentials such as connection URLs, cloud provider regions, and so on.

#### (Optional) Add JDBC drivers

JDBC sources may require you to uplod [JDBC drivers](/docs/foundry/available-connectors/custom-jdbc-sources/#jdbc-drivers), then specifying which Java class from the driver should be used.

#### (Optional) Add certificates

External systems might require certificates to ensure the connection can be trusted. This would occur for the following:

* Systems using TLS with self-signed certificates, for which you will need to add **server certificates**.
* Systems using mTLS which require the Foundry client to prove its identity with a **client certificate**.

To understand if you should add server or client certificates, [review our FAQ](/docs/foundry/data-connection/faq/#should-i-add-my-certificate-as-a-server-or-client-certificate).

For Foundry worker connections, add certificates on to the source itself using the following steps:

1. At the bottom of the **Connection details** page, select **More options**.
2. Choose **Configure server certificates** or **Configure client certificates and private key**.

![Configure a new server certificate.](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/configure-server-certificates.png)

3. Provide an alias, and paste the certificate.

![The fields to enter the alias and server certificate content.](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/add-server-certificate.png)

The certificate should be added as a string similar to the below example, including newlines but without a trailing newline character. The certificate shown below is the public certificate for `https://palantir.com`. Note that you cannot enter a certificate chain; you must enter each certificate separately.

```

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

For client certificates, you can also add an optional private key in a `PKCS#8` or `RSA` format. These are similar to the certificate format, but with a `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` (`PKCS#8`) or `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` (`RSA`) header.

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Learn how to [configure certificates on an agent when using agent worker connections.](/docs/foundry/data-connection/agent-configuration-reference/#certificates).
:::

### Add credentials

Add the credentials you [provisioned](#provision-credentials) previously to allow the source to connect to your data.

### Save and continue

Select **Save** in the bottom-right to complete setting up your source. Once your source is fully set up, you can proceed to [set up a sync](/docs/foundry/data-connection/set-up-sync/) to bring data into Foundry.

## Troubleshooting

Preview the source by selecting **Preview** in the right panel to confirm the connection has been successfully established.
If the source does not work properly, refer to our [sync troubleshooting documentation](/docs/foundry/data-connection/syncs-troubleshooting/). If you are using an agent worker, review our [agent troubleshooting documentation](/docs/foundry/data-connection/agents-troubleshooting/) as well.

### Source terminal

A terminal, using the same connectivity settings as your source, is available to help you test network connectivity with your external systems using commands like `dig`, `curl`, `netcat` and `openssl`.

To open the terminal select **Debug** in the **Network Connectivity** panel under **Connection details**.

![The source terminal is accessible via the 'connection settings' tab.](/docs/resources/foundry/data-connection/source-terminal.png)

#### dig

The `dig` command tests DNS resolution, and can be used to check whether the hostname of your source is being correctly resolved.

For example, to test if DNS can be resolved to `palantir.com`, you can use the command `dig palantir.com`. If you see an `ANSWER SECTION` in the response, the DNS resolution succeeded.

The following is an example of a successful `dig` command:

```
appuser@localhost:/root$ dig palantir.com

```

#### curl

The `curl` command tests HTTP connectivity to a specific host and port on the external system. If the port is not specified, the port will be inferred from the protocol (for example, 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).

For example, to test if connectivity can be established to `https://palantir.com`, you can use the command `curl https://palantir.com`.

The following is an example of a successful `curl` command:

```
appuser@localhost:/root$ curl https://palantir.com
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>301 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="https://www.palantir.com/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
```

If the `curl` command is hanging, try setting a timeout (in seconds) using the `--connect-timeout` flag:

```shell
curl --connect-timeout 10 https://palantir.com
```

#### openssl

The `openssl` command can help test SSL/TLS connectivity and verify certificates for HTTPS connections.

For example, to test if an SSL/TLS connection can be established to `palantir.com` on port `443`, you can use the command `openssl s_client -connect palantir.com:443 -servername palantir.com`.

The following is an example of a successful `openssl` command:

```
appuser@localhost:/root$ openssl s_client -connect palantir.com:443 -servername palantir.com
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=2 C = BE, O = GlobalSign nv-sa, OU = Root CA, CN = GlobalSign Root CA
verify return:1
depth=1 C = BE, O = GlobalSign nv-sa, CN = GlobalSign Atlas R3 DV TLS CA 2024 Q2
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = *.palantir.com
verify return:1
---
Certificate chain
 0 s:CN = *.palantir.com
   i:C = BE, O = GlobalSign nv-sa, CN = GlobalSign Atlas R3 DV TLS CA 2024 Q2

---
SSL handshake has read 3654 bytes and written 442 bytes
---
```

If the connection is successful, you will see certificate details and a message indicating the SSL handshake completed. If the command hangs or shows certificate verification errors, there may be network or certificate configuration issues.

Certificates configured in the UI are not directly included in the terminal environment. To use them in the terminal, you will first need to add them manually. This can be done inline or with `nano`/`vim`.

```shell
echo "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIGXjCCBUagAwIBAgIQASByQ6gv8Z6X7wEqsyBb1DANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBY
...
9lc=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----" > server-cert.pem
```

To test with the custom certificates, such as self-signed certificates or mTLS, you can specify the certificate files as following:

```shell
openssl s_client -connect my-server.example.com:443 \
  -servername my-server.example.com \
  -CAfile server-cert.pem \
  -cert client-cert.pem \
  -key client-key.pem
```

If these commands are successful and your connection is still not working, it is likely that some certificates or source credentials are configured incorrectly.
