# Getting started

In this tutorial, you will install an alert inbox application using a notional datasource that contains car part issues, which we have provided as its own Marketplace product.

To begin, navigate to Marketplace on your Foundry instance and search for `Marketplace Getting Started Tutorial - Datasource`, as below. If you are not able to locate this product, contact your Palantir representative.

![search bar](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-search.png)

## Install your datasource

Once you have located the tutorial datasource, click **Install** in the top right corner. If someone in your organization has already created an installation that you have access to, you will instead see an **Open** and  **Install again** button. In this case, select **Install again** to proceed with the installation.

![begin installation](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-datasource-overview.png)

When installing:

* Choose a [project](/docs/foundry/security/projects-and-roles/) to install into. The namespace is derived from the location of the project.
* As the product only contains a dataset, an [Ontology](/docs/foundry/ontologies/ontologies-overview/) is not required.
* This product does not have any inputs, so you can skip all other steps and select **Install** at the bottom of the left panel.

![datasource installation flow](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-datasource-installation-flow.png)

After beginning your installation, you will land on the installation job page. Once your installation is complete, select **View installation** in the upper right corner. From here, open up your `Car Part Issues - Source` dataset in a new tab. Return to the tab with your datasource installation.

## Install your application

We will now begin installing our target application using our `Car Part Issues - Source` dataset as input. Using the product search bar in the header, search for `Marketplace Getting Started Tutorial - Alert Inbox`. This product also belongs in the **Reference Resources** store. Similar to the datasource product, click **Install** in the top right corner to begin installation, and if someone in your organization has already created an installation, select the **Install again** button to proceed with the installation.

![begin installation](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-application-overview.png)

### General

* Choose a [project](/docs/foundry/security/projects-and-roles/) to install into. The namespace is derived from the location of the project.
* Choose an [ontology](/docs/foundry/ontologies/ontologies-overview/) to install into. If you do not see the ontology you want, contact your platform administrator, as this means that you do not have permission to edit.

### Inputs

Unlike your first installation, you will need to map an input to create the alert inbox application. This will be the `Car Part Issues - Source` that you have just installed, containing the notional issues data that will populate the alert inbox. To map this input:

From the tab where you've opened the `Car Part Issues - Source`, copy the filepath by clicking **File** in the top left and then **Copy full path** as below.

![copy path](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-copy-path.png)

You now need to map your `Car Part Issues - Source` to  satisfy the alert inbox product's one required input. To do so, return to your installation and click **Select**, and then paste the filepath you copied into search and select your dataset.

![unmapped input](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-unmapped-input.png)

If all columns have mapped correctly, you will see a blue tick mark as below.

### Content

This step confirms what will be installed, in this case a [Workshop application](/docs/foundry/workshop/overview/), an [object type](/docs/foundry/object-link-types/object-types-overview/), and three [action types](/docs/foundry/action-types/overview/).

Toggle on **Prefix ontology entities** to customize the names of your object types and actions. We recommend using your name for this tutorial.

### New versions

You can skip this step for this tutorial. To read more about automatic upgrades, release channels, and maintenance windows, visit the [installation documentation](/docs/foundry/marketplace/install-product/#new-versions).

### Review

Once your input mapping is complete and you are happy with your installation location and name customization, select **Install**.

![review](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-review.png)

### Installation job

After beginning your installation, you will land on the installation job page. Once your installation is complete, select **View installation** in the top-right corner.

## Open your application

From your installation, open up your `Marketplace Tutorial - Alert Inbox` application in a new tab. It may take a few minutes for your `Car Part Issue` objects to index, before which your application will not be available.

![open inbox](/docs/resources/foundry/marketplace/tutorial-inbox-installation.png)

You now have an alert inbox workshop application to help you triage your `Car Part Issues - Source` issues! As long as the required input columns are present, you can install this application again with any issues source to use it for new use cases.
