# The Pilot workspace

The Pilot workspace is where you interact with AI agents to build, preview, and refine your application. This page describes each area of the workspace.

## Workspace layout

The workspace is divided into two main areas:

* **Chat panel** (left): The AI chat interface where you provide instructions, view agent activity, and manage context attachments
* **Application view** (center): Tabbed views for previewing, inspecting, and debugging your application

![The Pilot workspace layout, with the chat panel on the left and application view tabs on the right.](/docs/resources/foundry/pilot/pilot-workspace-layout.png)

## Chat panel

The chat panel is your primary interface for communicating with Pilot. It includes the following:

* **Message history:** Displays your prompts, agent responses, tool executions, and reasoning steps. Pilot shows what each agent is doing in real time, including file reads, edits, and bash commands.
* **Prompt input:** A text area at the bottom where you can type instructions. Select **Send** or press `Enter` to submit your prompt.
* **Add menu:** Select **Add** to attach context to your prompt, including existing ontology entities, documents, and images. See [Provide context and attachments](/docs/foundry/pilot/provide-context/) for details.
* **More menu:** Select the **More** menu for additional options, including model selection and clearing the chat history. For details on available models, see [Models and agent modes](/docs/foundry/pilot/models-and-modes/).

When Pilot spawns a specialized subagent such as the designer or ontology architect, the chat panel displays a separate thread for that subagent's activity. You can switch between the main thread and subagent threads to follow their work.

## Preview tab

The **Preview** tab displays a live preview of your generated application running inside the provisioned container. The preview updates automatically when Pilot modifies application code.

The **Preview** tab includes a browser-style toolbar with the following features:

* **Navigation buttons:** Back, forward, and reload controls for navigating within the preview.
* **URL bar:** Displays the current preview URL.
* **Device selector:** Switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile viewport sizes to preview your application at different screen sizes. The preview auto-scales to fit the selected device frame.

In editor view, the preview uses seed data from the Pilot container. In deploy view, your application connects to real ontology data. On a deployment branch, schema changes are scoped to that branch; on `Main`, any actions are live ontology edits.

## Ontology tab

The **Ontology** tab displays an interactive graph of the object types, action types, and relationships that Pilot created for your application. For a detailed walkthrough, see the [ontology tab](/docs/foundry/pilot/ontology-tab/) documentation.

## Code tab

The **Code** tab provides an embedded code editor where you can view and edit the source code for your generated application. The editor uses the same interface as Code Workspaces. You can also make code changes through the chat interface.

## More tab (**...**)

The More (**...**) tab currently has one item, **Pilot logs**, which display real-time container logs from the Pilot development server. Use this tab for the following actions:

* Monitor build output and compilation status.
* Debug runtime errors.
* View dependency installation progress.

You can copy log contents to the clipboard using the copy button.

## Content header

The content header sits above the tab views and provides the following features:

* **Editor/Deploy toggle:** Switch between editor view (seed data) and deploy view (real ontology data). For details, see [Deploy an application](/docs/foundry/pilot/deploy-an-application/).
* **Version selector:** View and switch between versions of your application.
* **Tab navigation:** Switch between **Preview**, **Ontology**, **Code**, and **Pilot logs** tabs.
* **Status indicator:** Select to open the status monitoring popover.

## Editor and deploy views

The **Editor/Deploy** toggle in the content header controls which data your application displays.

* **Editor view:** Shows your application with seed data generated inside the Pilot container. This is the default view while building. Seed data prevents AI agents from accessing or hard-coding real enterprise data.
* **Deploy view:** Shows your application against real ontology data on a branch. Use this view to validate that your application works correctly with production data before releasing.

For a complete walkthrough of the deployment process, see [Deploy an application](/docs/foundry/pilot/deploy-an-application/).

## Status monitoring

The status indicator in the top-right corner of the content header shows the overall health of your Pilot session. Select it to open the status monitoring popover, which displays the following information:

* **Pilot status:** Whether the Pilot connection is healthy or disconnected.
* **Development server:** Whether the development server is running, inactive, or has build errors.
* **Dependencies:** Whether package dependencies are installed, installing, or failed.
* **Deployability:** Whether the application is ready to deploy, not deployable, or has invalid ontology entities.
* **Upgrades:** Whether dependencies are up to date or outdated.

Each status item includes an action to resolve issues. For most problems, you can select **Fix with Pilot** to prompt Pilot to diagnose and apply a fix automatically.
