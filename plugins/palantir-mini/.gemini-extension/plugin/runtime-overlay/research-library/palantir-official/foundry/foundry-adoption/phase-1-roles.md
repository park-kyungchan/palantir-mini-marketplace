# Phase 1: Roles and responsibilities

The following roles and responsibilities are suggestions based on experience working to develop Program teams for use cases and organizations of all sizes and scopes. These suggestions are meant to outline the organizational needs often faced when establishing and scaling a Foundry Program; depending on your needs and use cases, this does not necessarily mean your organization must fill each role at all times.

## Head of Program

### Responsibilities

The primary owner and driver of the Foundry Program's success, setting and communicating the vision for the Foundry Program across the organization.

* Work closely with senior stakeholders and relevant executives to maintain a feedback loop between the Foundry Program and the rest of leadership. This includes reporting on program status, ingesting organization-wide strategy, and collaborating to find new opportunities for digital transformation through Foundry across organizations.
* Collaborate with Platform and Data Governance teams on use case governance by developing and enforcing processes to ensure use cases comply with governance requirements, from inception and scoping through launch and maintenance.
* Set the high-level direction of the program's process and scaling requirements by working with the [Program Manager](#program-manager) to use this vision to guide processes, governance, and best practices across teams and in cross-functional collaboration efforts.
* Collaborate with domain leads to evaluate, prioritize, and approve or reject new use case requests, based on the overall vision of the program and the organization's strategy at that time.

### Profile and required skills

* Typically reports directly to senior / executive sponsors
* Proven leadership and management skills
* Deep understanding of organization-wide vision and strategy
* Background in strategy and effective development of software platform
* Excellent communicator and motivator

### Relevant Foundry applications and resources

* [Approvals](/docs/foundry/approvals/overview/) application
* [Foundry Program team](/docs/foundry/foundry-adoption/program-overview/)
* [Palantir Platform Overview](/docs/foundry/platform-overview/overview/)
* [Ontology Overview](/docs/foundry/ontology/overview/)

## Program Manager

### Responsibilities

* Standardize and enforce Foundry development best practices across use cases, working closely with Data Governance and Platform teams and use case leadership to create practices that make sense for the organization's SOPs and team structures.
* Partner with the Head of Program to own cross-functional communication and evangelization of the Foundry Program across other organization verticals and program area owners. This level of communication is generally one step down from senior leadership and executives.
* Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders on change, risk, and resource management frameworks. In Phase 1, these may be high-level and largely driven by external stakeholders with experience in those business areas (risk teams, staffing teams, information officers), but the Program Manager is responsible for creating and socializing these basic artifacts for the program. As the program grows, ownership for these artifacts can be passed to appropriate owners, such as the [Head of Platform](#head-of-program) or the [Head of Data Governance](#head-of-data-governance).
* Create frameworks to assess performance within and across use cases and teams. This includes setting and managing OKRs and KPIs, and creating aggregate reporting to document progress and areas of opportunity across different parts of the program.
* Own end-to-end use case scoping and development to drive increased value and overall digital transformation.
* Collaborate closely with engineers and application developers, delivering and iterating on requirements through writing of tasks, drawing diagrams, workflows and wireframes, testing new features and workflows, and liaising with stakeholders throughout the development process.
* Work with Domain Leads to ensure the alignment of both technical and operational goals; collaborate on goals and desired outcomes for the use case, and reach an agreed set of metrics and reporting to monitor progress and success.

### Profile and required skills

* Experience managing cross-functional programs
* Experience managing technical and organizational projects and reporting to senior/executive stakeholders
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Familiarity with the structure of the organization and how to navigate it
* Excellent leadership and organizational skills

### Relevant Foundry applications and resources

* [Project access](/docs/foundry/security/projects-and-roles/#request-access-to-a-project)
* [Approvals](/docs/foundry/approvals/overview/) application
* [Enrollment permissions](/docs/foundry/administration/enrollments-and-organizations-permissions/)
* [Foundry program governance](/docs/foundry/foundry-adoption/governance-processes/)
* User and platform settings

## Head of Data Governance

### Responsibilities

* Work with Compliance, Legal, and Data Protection (or similar teams) to ensure laws and requirements are reflected in the way data is processed within Foundry, including the approach to processing sensitive data
* Focus on making data usable, in compliance with internal and external data quality standards and SLAs.
* Own the documentation and maintenance of data governance requirements, and communicate these across workstreams.
* Build monitoring and metrics around data governance processes, and own the continuous reporting and adjustment of these systems.
* Partner with Permissions Managers and the Data Lead to implement groups and roles in project permissions. Create documentation and repeatable workflows across common project types along with workflows to enable self-service on data governance requirements as applied to each project type.
* Implement data governance review processes across all workstreams within the Foundry Program. Work with team leads to understand their workstream needs and processes, and implement data governance checks, requirements, and processes to ensure data governance standards are being met across the Program.
* If needed, interface with Palantir teams for support services delivery; leverage Palantir resources, including documentation, advisory teams, and support services, to implement a data governance program in alignment with your organization's needs and with adequate vendor support systems in place.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
Within Phase 1, the Head of Data Governance role can often be assumed by the [Data Lead](#data-lead) or the [Ontology Lead](#ontology-lead). However, we recommend assigning this as a standalone role with dedicated resourcing by Phase 3 at the latest due to the scale of data management and complexity of workflows and use cases.
