# Ontology MCP (OMCP)

Ontology MCP (OMCP) is a Developer Console feature that exposes your application's ontology resources as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. This enables AI agents and external systems to interact with your ontology as MCP clients.

:::callout{theme="neutral" title="Beta"}
Ontology MCP is in the [beta](/docs/foundry/platform-overview/development-life-cycle/) phase of development and may not be available on your enrollment. Functionality may change during active development.
:::

## What is Ontology MCP?

Ontology MCP makes your application's ontology resources (such as object types, action types, and query functions) available as MCP tools. External AI agents can then discover and use these tools to read objects, execute actions, and query data from your ontology.

The [Model Context Protocol ↗](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open standard that enables AI systems to securely connect to external data sources and tools. By enabling Ontology MCP, your application becomes an MCP server that AI agents can connect to as MCP clients.

## Ontology MCP vs. Palantir MCP

Ontology MCP and [Palantir MCP](/docs/foundry/palantir-mcp/overview/) serve different purposes:

* **Ontology MCP (OMCP)** is designed for ontology *consumers*: external AI agents that need to safely *write data* to your ontology. Ontology MCP allows LLM agents to read objects, execute predefined actions, and query data, while restricting which actions the agent can take through [application restrictions](/docs/foundry/developer-console/application-restrictions/). This makes it safe for external agents to interact with production ontology data.

* **Palantir MCP** is designed for ontology *builders*, such as developers working with OSDK applications, datasets, transforms, and ontology development. Palantir MCP provides 70+ tools for building and modifying ontology *types* (object types, link types, action types), but cannot write actual ontology data. Palantir MCP focuses on development workflows, not production data interaction.

In summary: Ontology MCP enables controlled writes to ontology data, while Palantir MCP enables modifications to ontology structure.

## LLM disclaimer

:::callout{theme="warning"}
By enabling Ontology MCP on your local device with LLMs hosted outside of Palantir AIP, you are making data in your Palantir environment available to an external MCP client. Ensure that this action is compliant with your organization's policies.
:::

When using Ontology MCP with external AI systems, consider the following:

* Review your organization's data governance and compliance policies before enabling Ontology MCP.
* Ensure that the ontology resources exposed through MCP comply with your data security requirements.
* Use [application restrictions](/docs/foundry/developer-console/application-restrictions/) and [permissions](/docs/foundry/developer-console/permissions/) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
