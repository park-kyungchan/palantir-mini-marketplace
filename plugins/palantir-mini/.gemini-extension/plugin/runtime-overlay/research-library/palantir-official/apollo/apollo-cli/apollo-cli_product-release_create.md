# apollo-cli product-release create

Creates a new product release in Apollo from an Apollo product manifest file or a product TGZ

Creates a new product release in Apollo from an Apollo product manifest file or a product TGZ. Publishes only metadata and not the actual artifacts themselves. If you want to create a product release in an enrollment you are not a member of the primary org for, then set the spaceID for the enrollment using the global '--space-id' flag.

```bash
apollo-cli product-release create [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag                      | Use                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `-h`, `--help` | Help for create |
| `--manifest` | Path to the Apollo product manifest file |

If "auto" is specified, will use either the Bearer Token provided by "apollo-token" or a Bearer Token obtained by using "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" to generate a token from Multipass depending on which values are set (but will error if both values are set). If "static" is specified, the token provided by "apollo-token" is used. If "service-user" is specified, "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" are used to generate a token from Multipass. |
