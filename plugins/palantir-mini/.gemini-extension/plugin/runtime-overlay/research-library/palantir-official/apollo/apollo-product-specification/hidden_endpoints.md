# Endpoints \[Beta]

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
Endpoints are in a beta state and may not be available on your Apollo Hub. Contact your Palantir representative to learn more.
:::

This extension of the specification defines how a service should declare endpoints for:

* Communicating with other services.
* Satisfying [readiness/liveness](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_liveness-and-readiness/)/[health](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/health/) checks.
* Receiving traffic from the public internet.

## Definition

A product **must** declare 1 or more endpoints in the `configuration.yml` file under the top level key `endpoints`.
The `endpoints` block consists of the following keys:

* `sls-status-endpoint`: String value that declares a specific endpoint from the `definitions` block as the SLS status endpoint. This key can be omitted if there is only 1 endpoint in the definitions block.
* `definitions`: A map of endpoint names to endpoint objects. The endpoint name is a kebab-cased string satisfying the character set \[a-z0-9] and must be unique within a service. All endpoint objects assume the protocol is TCP.

The endpoint object has the following fields:

* **desired-port** (*required*): An integer value. The value must be between 1024 and 19999, inclusive.
* **path** (*optional*): A string value which can specify the path for incoming requests to the endpoint. The value must start with `/`. If absent, this value defaults to `/`.
* **external-port** (*required*): For TCP/UDP endpoints, an integer value. Forbidden for HTTP(S) endpoints. Traffic that hits an environment on this external port will be forwarded to this endpoint.

A product may have multiple endpoints with the same port, as long as they have different paths.

Services can access their endpoints using the [substitution language's support for referencing endpoint definitions](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/#referencing-endpoint-definitions).

### Example Endpoints Block

```yaml
endpoints:
  sls-status-endpoint: service-endpoint       // (optional) specifies an endpoint in the definitions block that
                                              //            serves SLS status checks, can
                                              //            be omitted if definitions only have 1 endpoint
  definitions:                                // (required) defines a map of endpoints for
                                              //            the service, must have at least 1
    version-endpoint:                         // (required) names are unique across a service
      desired-port: 9000                      // (required) port number
      path: /version                          // (optional) context path if applicable, defaults to /
    ping-endpoint:
      desired-port: 9001
    upgrade-endpoint:
      desired-port: 90001
      path: /upgrade
    service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /my-app
```

## Manifest Extension Fields

The following optional fields are added to the `extensions` block of the manifest:

* **public-proxy-endpoints**: A list of service endpoints to mount on the internet-facing proxy; by default, contains no endpoints.
  * Endpoints that are listed under this field must have corresponding definitions in the `configuration.yml`'s `endpoints` block.
  * An endpoint name may only be present in one of `public-tcp-endpoints` and `public-proxy-endpoints`.
  * Endpoints in this list must not have external port specified.
* **require-stable-hostname**: Boolean, defaults to *false*.
  * Controls whether individual replicas of this service receives a stable hostnames.
  * By default, replica hostnames are dynamic and can change upon replica replacement.
* **public-tcp-endpoints**: A list of service endpoints to mount on the internet facing proxy that receive TCP traffic.
  * Endpoints that are listed under this field must have corresponding definitions in the `configuration.yml`'s `endpoints` block.
  * An endpoint name may only be present in one of `public-tcp-endpoints` and `public-proxy-endpoints`.
  * An endpoint may be present in both `public-udp-endpoints` and `public-tcp-endpoints` if the endpoint would like to receive UDP/TCP traffic to the same `external-port`.
  * Endpoints in this list **must not** have a path specified.
  * Endpoints in this list **must** have external port specified.
* **public-udp-endpoints**: A list of service endpoints to mount on the internet facing proxy that receive UDP traffic.
  * Endpoints that are listed under this field but lack corresponding definitions in the configuration will be ignored.
  * An endpoint name may only be present in one of `public-udp-endpoints` and `public-proxy-endpoints`.
  * An endpoint may be present in both `public-udp-endpoints` and `public-tcp-endpoints` if the endpoint would like to receive UDP/TCP traffic to the same `external-port`.
  * Endpoints in this list **must not** have a path specified.
  * Endpoints in this list **must** have external port specified.

## Example Usage

The following `manifest.yml` and `configuration.yml` illustrates how a service would use the above fields.

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  public-proxy-endpoints:
    - service-endpoint
  public-tcp-endpoints:
    - tcp-service-endpoint
  public-udp-endpoints:
    - udp-service-endpoint
```

```yaml
# configuration.yml
endpoints:
  definitions:
    service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /my-service-endpoint-path
    tcp-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 4567
      external-port: 22
    udp-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 5678
      external-port: 1234
default_conf:
  server:
    my-service:
      port: '{{ endpoints.definitions.service-endpoint.port}}'
      path: '{{ endpoints.definitions.service-endpoint.path }}'
    my-tcp:
      port: '{{ endpoints.definitions.tcp-service-endpoint.port}}'
    my-udp:
      port: '{{ endpoints.definitions.udp-service-endpoint.port}}'
```

With the definition above, SLS liveness and readiness checks will hit port 8080 of the service.
Since `public-proxy-endpoints` lists the `service-endpoint`, the service endpoint will be exposed outside of the cluster at the path `/my-service-endpoint-path`.
