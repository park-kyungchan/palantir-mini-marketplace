### Introducing Apollo Debug Terminals

Apollo Debug Terminals are now available on all Apollo Hubs, providing an interactive shell for debugging your Environments directly from Apollo. You can run `kubectl` commands to inspect the configuration, health, and logs of containers running in Kubernetes directly from your browser.

Each terminal session is time-bound to four hours, isolated from other users' sessions, and uses Kubernetes RBAC scoped to your Apollo roles. By default, terminals grant read-only access to a limited set of Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps. To launch a terminal session, navigate to the **Terminal** tab in the Environment you want to debug — you will need the Environment Terminal User role.

![Example terminal session on an Apollo Environment.](/docs/resources/apollo/core/2026-05-08-131021-autopilot-terminal-interact-pn.png)

*Example terminal session on an Apollo Environment.*

When a debugging task requires elevated permissions, you can request a just-in-time (JIT) access policy from the same tab. Once an Environment Administrator approves the request, the additional permissions apply within seconds to both active and new terminal sessions. Each grant is time-bound and expires automatically after the policy's configured duration — you can extend an active grant if you need more time, or revoke it earlier at any point.

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.752.0 has removed all deprecated commands that were scheduled for removal in 2025. The following commands have been removed: `add-unmanaged-service`, `installation`, `list`, `create-environment`,  and `delete-environment`. This cleanup improves the CLI by removing outdated functionality while preserving essential commands.
* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.751.0 now supports installing specific versions of Modules onto an Environment. You can specify the exact Module version you want to install using the command: `apollo-cli module install module:foo:1.2.3 -e <environment-id>`. This enhancement enables scripting of Module installations across multiple Environments with precise version control.

***

## 2026-04-14

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.735.0 now supports retrieving multiple Product Releases in a single operation with the new `product-release batch-get` command. This restores batch functionality that was previously available in the deprecated `get-product-releases` command. You can specify multiple Product Releases using the `-m` flag followed by a comma-separated list of product coordinates: `apollo-cli product-release batch-get -m "com.palantir.example:product-a:1.0.0,com.palantir.example:product-b:2.0.0"`

## 2026-04-02

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - You can now categorize vulnerability suppressions as `Planned fix` in Apollo. This new category joins the existing options (Won't fix, False positive, and Vendor dependency) when creating or managing suppressions. Use this suppression category to indicate that a fix for the vulnerability is planned and scheduled for release. You will need to provide evidence of the planned fix, such as a link to a vendor's advisory or an issue ticket.

***

## 2026-03-26

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - You can now configure which sensitive recall metadata is included in Bundles sent to Target Hubs in Apollo. A new **Edit sensitive data settings** action is available in the Target Hub actions menu. This action opens a dialog where you can choose whether to include recall categories and recall rationales in bundles sent to the selected Target Hub.

***

## 2026-03-24

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays visual indicators for Bundle approval statuses. The most recent Bundle requiring approval shows an `Action required` tag in both the import inbox and Pipeline overview. Bundles with failed approvals display a failed status icon. These indicators help you quickly identify Bundles that need attention.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides two separate security report download options. You can access these options from both the **Vulnerabilities** tab and the Environment **Actions** menu. The new options include:
  * **Download vulnerability summary:** A CSV containing high-level information about vulnerabilities, including ID, description, severity, finding counts, and suppression breakdowns.
  * **Download finding details:** A CSV with detailed information about individual findings.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now supports multiple Module installation actions within a single change request. You can also view linked Module installations in change requests, providing better visibility when importing changes from another Hub.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays pending change requests in the import inbox status section. When a Bundle has finished uploading and converting but has pending change requests, you can view their status organized by approval state. The status section shows whether approvals are partially pending or failed, with appropriate visual indicators and a progress bar reflecting the current state. You can view all pending approvals or navigate directly to specific change requests using the provided buttons.

***

## 2026-03-23

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Bundle status indicators in Apollo now use icons instead of tags for export and import operations. This provides a more consistent visual representation of Bundle statuses across different inbox views.

***

## 2026-03-19

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.708.0 includes updates the `environment config` commands that improve usability. The `output-dir` flag is now required for the `environment config get` command to ensure output is properly directed to files rather than stdout. Additionally, you can now combine `environment config get` and `environment config apply` to open a change request with local changes. The `--description` flag is no longer required when using the `environment config apply` command.

***

## 2026-03-18

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - The environment actions menu in Apollo has been reorganized with nested submenus to improve navigation. Related actions are now grouped together in two new submenus: **Manage Entities & Modules** consolidates Entity and Module installation and management options, while **Download** groups all download options in one place. This organization reduces menu overflow and makes it easier to find specific actions.
* *Improvement* - The Module installation config editor in Apollo now visually indicates which configuration lines are managed by a Module versus manually overridden. Module-owned lines are highlighted and include a link to the Module installation, while manually overridden lines show a warning background with a `Manual override` annotation. Module variable values are displayed with tag-styled decorations and hover tooltips showing the variable name. Additionally, validation prevents submission when Module-owned keys are modified in non-merge mode, with clear error messages and disabled Review/Submit buttons.

***

## 2026-03-12

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays indicators when an Environment has Bundle imports pending approval. A banner and an action card in the Environment **Overview** page alert you to pending approvals. Selecting either indicator takes you directly to the change request page filtered to show import Pipeline change requests pending approval for that Environment.
* *Improvement* - You can now view change requests for import Pipelines in Apollo. The new **Changes** tab in the import Pipeline history page displays all change requests associated with a specific Pipeline. You can filter the change requests and reset filters to view all changes scoped to the Pipeline.

***

## 2026-03-06

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays consistent status cards for all promotion states (running, succeeded, and aborted). Aborted promotions show cancellation reason and timestamp information, and display constraint results when canary soaking occurred before the abort. This standardized approach improves visibility into promotion status across all states.

***

## 2026-03-05

### Latest changes

* *Fix* - Apollo now correctly displays all in-progress promotions in the promotion pipeline graph, including those for versions that are not the most recent on any Release Channel. When multiple versions are being promoted to the same stage simultaneously, they appear in a collapsed list for better visibility.

***

## 2026-02-26

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now view and edit Entity versions for Environments that are exported in Pipelines. A new **Target Hub versions** tab provides the ability to view current Entity versions on an Environment, download versions as JSON, edit versions directly or through JSON upload, and revert changes. This feature helps ensure correct Entity versions when multiple Pipelines ship to the same target Hub.
* *Improvement* - You can now edit the current Entity versions for exported Environments in Apollo. This feature helps ensure correct incremental bundle assembly when multiple Pipelines export to the same Target Hub. From the **Target Hub versions** tab in a Pipeline, you can view, download, and edit the current Entity versions on the Environment. You can make edits directly in your Apollo Hub or by uploading JSON, and revert changes as needed.

***

## 2026-02-19

### Latest changes

* *Fix* - Apollo CLI version 0.673.0 fixes the example template in the `product promotion append` command's help text to match the actual required format. The corrected documentation now properly shows how to structure the JSON template with the `stage` wrapper, ISO 8601 duration format for soak time, and the correct field name `onlyPossibleLabelValues`. This prevents the `json: unknown field` errors that users previously encountered when following the documented examples.

***

## 2026-02-18

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.669.0 includes commands for managing change requests. You can use the new [`changerequest` subcommand](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_changerequest/) to list, approve, cancel, reject, and reopen change requests directly from the command line interface.

***

## 2026-02-11

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - As of Apollo CLI version 0.654.0, the `environment release-channel set` command now accepts multiple Environment IDs, allowing you to update Release Channels across multiple Environments in a single operation.

A summary of successes and failures is displayed upon completion.
* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.652.0 supports the ability to switch an Environment to a specific Release Channel directly from the command line interface. You can do this using the [`environment release-channel set`](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_environment_release-channel_set/) command.

***

## 2026-02-10

### Latest changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.647.0 includes a new `release-channel diff` command that allows you to compare Releases between two Release Channels for Products in a specific Environment. This command shows which Product Releases exist on the source channel but not on the target channel. This is useful for identifying Releases that need to be promoted from one channel to another. To do this, run the following command: `apollo-cli release-channel diff <environment-id> -s <source-channel> -T <target-channel>`. Flags:
  * `--source-channel` or `-S` (required): Source Release Channel to compare from.
  * `--target-channel` or `-T` (required): Target Release Channel to compare against.
  * `--all`: Show all Products including those already up to date.
* *Improvement* - Users can now add a column displaying the default Release Channel in the Environments table by selecting the gear icon in the Environments table and enabling the **Default Channel** field. This column is not visible by default but can be added to the table view and will persist across page refreshes. The column supports sorting functionality.
* *Improvement* - You can now add a **Default Channel** column to the Environments table in Apollo. This column displays the default Release Channel associated with each Environment. The column is sortable and persists across page refreshes once added.

### Stagger Product upgrades with ramped rollouts

Ramped rollouts are now available on all Apollo Hubs, allowing you to stagger Product upgrades within a Release Channel. A ramped rollout is a rate-limiting mechanism that distributes Entity upgrades across a specified time window.

Ramped rollouts are useful for Products with a large number of Entities. Rather than upgrading all the Entities at once, ramped rollouts allow upgrades to happen gradually. This enables earlier detection of issues and reduces the risk of widespread incidents.

![Diagram that shows how Product upgrades are staggered throughout the rollout window when ramped rollouts are used.](/docs/resources/apollo/core/2025-12-01-160116-autopilot-ramped-rollouts-pn.png)

*Diagram that shows how Product upgrades are staggered throughout the rollout window when ramped rollouts are used.*

You can configure ramped rollouts in your Product's **Upgrade** settings. For each Release Channel in the promotion pipeline, you can define a rollout window over which upgrades should be distributed.

![Example Product settings with ramped rollouts configured.](/docs/resources/apollo/core/2025-12-01-160124-autopilot-edit-product-settings-ramped-rollout-pn.png)

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides Hub export settings that allow you to customize the metadata of a Hub for export. You can specify the display name and control exportability settings using the new **Import & Export** tab in your Hub settings.
* *Improvement* - Users can now select the [connection settings](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-connection-settings/) when creating a new Environment in Apollo. This determines whether agents in the Environment will connect directly to the current Hub or to another Hub.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays a settings tag that indicates whether Environment settings are editable in the current Hub or a different one. Select this tag to [switch the edit source](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-edit-source/) for Environment settings.
* *Improvement* - Module preset variables are now displayed in multiple locations throughout your Apollo Hub. You can view Module variables in the overview page, details panel, content inbox, and installed Module details. When installing or updating Modules, you can configure preset variables with a preview that reflects changes. Module variable configurations are also visible in change requests.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays the current tag in Environment edit source and connection settings dialogs. The Hub link has been improved to direct users to the specific Environment in the other Hub. When a Hub is not known, it will display as "Unknown Hub" instead of "Another Hub". Warning messages for edit source have also been updated to provide clearer guidance.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides a streamlined interface for no-source, undetermined, and relayed Entities. The Entity overview for these types no longer displays installation status tags, plans, node health widgets, or status fields. Related tabs such as activity, health, monitors, resources, and security have been removed. Entity actions like Mute and manage secrets are disabled with explanatory tooltips. In the Modules view, these Entities display only count information without status indicators.
* *Improvement* - A warning callout is now displayed when an Environment has undetermined reported state, providing clearer visibility into connection issues. Additionally, the Environment agent status tag has been updated to reflect the reported state source. Users can now access connection settings directly from the connection status tag for more efficient troubleshooting.
* *Improvement* - Callouts are now displayed for Environments with mirrored declared state source in read-only mode. When an Environment has this source type, users cannot edit configurations in the current Hub. Actions such as editing environment or entity configurations, modifying artifact registries, and installing or uninstalling modules are disabled.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now restricts certain Environment actions based on the reported state source. The manage secrets dialog is read-only when the reported state source is relayed. For Environments with agents reported state source, the config editability cannot be set to downstream. Additionally, some Environment actions such as generate manifest and Environment setup steps are disabled based on the reported state source.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides direct links to recalls in notifications for open-ended recalls. When you receive a notification about an open-ended recall, you can select the link to navigate directly to the recall details.
* * *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.518.0 adds supports an `--ignore-recalls` flag for the Module install command. This allows you to proceed with a Module installation even if all Releases of a Product are recalled.
* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.519.0 provides an `--ignore-secret-requirements` flag for installing or updating Modules. This allows a Module installation or update to proceed even if the secrets the Module requires have not been set, giving users more flexibility in Module management workflows.
* * *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.524.0 introduces improvements to the help text for Apollo CLI publish commands. The help text now more clearly explains what each command does, making it easier to understand which command to use for specific needs.
* *Improvement* - Apollo CLI version 0.531.0 allows users to specify a space ID in various Apollo CLI commands. This enhancement allows guest users to work with spaces they have access to, even if they are not part of the primary organization that owns the space. Commands that now support space ID specification include product-release create, product-release asset publish, and several others.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now uses role-based access control (RBAC) for team management operations. Users with appropriate permissions can create, update, or delete teams directly without requiring change requests to be approved.

### Introducing Environment edit source

Environment editors can now configure the edit source for an Environment. The edit source determines where the Environment's settings can be modified.

[Learn more about Environment edit source](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-edit-source/).

***

## 2025-09-17

### Introducing Environment connection settings

Environment editors can now configure the connection settings for an Environment. Connection settings determine how Apollo handles [agent connectivity](/docs/apollo/core/agents/) for an Environment. This replaces the previous `LOCAL` and `REMOTE` Environment types which are being deprecated.

[Learn more about Environment connection settings](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-connection-settings/).

***

## 2025-09-16

### Introducing Module preset variables

Preset variables allow you to define groups of related variables that are configured together. With preset variables, you can simplify Module configuration by defining presets for multiple variables and exposing them through an intuitive control. A common use case is resource profiles, where selecting a single profile option (like "small", "medium", or "large") automatically configures resources such as CPU and memory values for the target environment appropriately.

[Learn more about preset variables](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/create-module/#preset-variables).

***

## 2025-09-11

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now sort the Entity status column in Apollo installations. The sort order prioritizes different statuses with blocked Entities appearing first, followed by temporarily blocked, ongoing changes, up to date, and not reported Entities. Both ascending and descending sort orders are supported.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays the dependency group field in the Entity details widget on the **Overview** page and in the Entity **Details** panel. This additional information helps users better understand Entity relationships and dependencies.
* *Improvement* - As of Apollo CLI version 500.0, users can now specify a space ID in the configure command. When provided, this space ID is prioritized over inferred spaces for various publishing commands including product-release create, product-release asset publish, and several deprecated commands. This enhancement is particularly useful for users who need to publish products to spaces not owned by their organization.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now allows users to switch the edit source of an Environment's settings between Hubs. Users with appropriate permissions can access this functionality through a new action in the Environment page, where they can select which Hub should manage the Environment's configuration and provide a rationale for the change.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides a multi-step workflow for editing the connection settings of an Environment. This workflow guides users through the process with a structured interface, making it easier to configure Environment connection settings.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides links to other Hubs when an Environment is controlled by another Hub. When viewing Environments, you can select the Hub link to navigate directly to the controlling Hub. If Hub metadata is not available, the Hub name will be displayed as text without a link. If no display name is set, it will show as "Another Hub".
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides options to select the edit source for Environment settings in pipelines. When configuring Environment rules, users can choose between 'mirrored' and 'upstream' options for the target declared state source, providing more flexibility in how Environment configurations are managed.

### Dependency groups now support Product Release incompatibilities

Product Release incompatibilities are now supported for [dependency groups](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-settings/#dependency-groups). An Entity will only consider a [Product Release incompatibility](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/product-incompatibilities/) active if the Entity shares at least one group with the target Entity.

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now edit a Module's product settings the same way as Products. Navigate to the **Settings** tab on a Module page to configure options such as contact teams.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays a warning when you attempt to edit an older version of an Entity config. The warning requires acknowledgment before proceeding with the edit, helping prevent unintentional modifications to outdated configurations.
* *Improvement* - The display name field has been removed from the team creation and update dialogs in Apollo. Team display names are now managed exclusively through the Edit action in the team **Properties** settings after team creation.
* *Improvement* - Module paths in Apollo now include space information in their URL structure, consistent with other resources like Environments and Products. This change supports working with Modules across different spaces in a Hub.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now uses Maven coordinates instead of Module IDs. When accessing a Module using a Module ID, you will be automatically redirected to the appropriate URL with the Module coordinate. The revision dropdown for Modules is also now Maven coordinate backed, allowing for more consistent Module identification.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays Maven coordinate versions instead of Module revisions throughout all Module workflows. Additionally, some Module statistics such as installations, Products, and submodules are no longer shown directly in the Module list but remain available in the details panel when selecting a Module.
* *Improvement* - As of Apollo CLI version 0.463.0, the contact team flag for the `apollo-cli environment get` command is optional. This changes ensures that Apollo CLI Environment commands work correctly for Environments without contact teams.

***

## 2025-07-15

### Introducing dependency groups

Environment editors can now configure dependency groups to organize Entities into logical groupings. With dependency groups configured, an Entity will only consider a dependency satisfied if the dependency shares at least one group with the dependent Entity.

Dependency groups are useful when you want to run multiple instances of a Product in a single Environment. For example, you may want to run one instance of a Product for staging and another instance of the same Product for production. With dependency groups, different instances of the same Product can depend on different instances of another Product.

You can configure dependency groups by [manually editing the Environment settings](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-settings/#edit-settings-manually).

[Learn more about dependency groups](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/environment-settings/#dependency-groups)

***

## 2025-07-01

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - A new **Product** column is now available in the Entity table on an Environment page. This column displays the Product associated with each Entity. The **Product** column is hidden by default, and users can change its visibility in the column settings. Hovering over a Product in this column displays additional information, and selecting a Product navigates to the Product page.
* *Improvement* - Users can now view Environment management settings even when they do not have edit permissions. Open the **Manage Environment** dialog to view the settings in read-only mode, with disabled fields and a message indicating the settings cannot be edited.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays the required Product Release labels constraint when defining a promotion pipeline. Users can view label requirements specified on a canary promotion for their Product, ensuring visibility of all constraints in the promotion workflow.
* *Improvement* - Team notifications now include a direct link to the change request search page with a pre-applied filter showing change requests pending approval from that team. This allows team members to quickly access and review all change requests awaiting their team's response.
* *Improvement* - Modules in Apollo now display their sharing status in the header and use Product-based RBAC and labels. The Module details panel has been improved with a more consistent loading experience, and the labels widget now properly reflects product information.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now enforces validation rules when deleting Modules and Module revisions. Shared Modules cannot be deleted, and Modules that have releases used as submodules in other Modules are protected from deletion. These validations are displayed in the user interface with appropriate action disabling and explanatory messages.

***

## 2025-06-03

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - The Module installation workflow now suggests variable values based on existing installations. When configuring a new Module installation, Apollo identifies Entities that are already managed by existing Module installations and presents variable value suggestions. If the new installation is configured to manage Entities that are already managed by existing Modules, users are prompted to unlink those existing installations before proceeding.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays "View change request" as a clickable link for change requests without titles. This ensures users can navigate to any change request from the table view, even when the change request has no title.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides a direct way to remove suppression windows and maintenance window overrides by adding an action in the suppression and maintenance window override banners. Users can select the new delete button that appears when hovering over items in the popover, which opens a confirmation dialog before removal.
* *Improvement* - The Module variable update dialog now provides validation feedback. When users attempt to update variables with values that would create conflicts, such as when an Entity is already managed by another installation, the dialog displays an error message and disables the submit button until the conflict is resolved.
* *Improvement* - The teams page of the Apollo Hub settings now features a dedicated **Contacts** tab. Users can create and manage team contact methods through this interface, replacing the previous **Edit team details** action. Each contact can be configured to receive notifications when notifications are enabled for a Hub. For example, if a Slack channel is specified as a contact method, notifications will be delivered directly to that channel.
* *Improvement* - Users can now cancel all active Plans for an Environment at once. This action is available in the Environment actions dropdown menu. When canceling Plans, users can include a rationale and choose whether to automatically create a suppression window after cancellation.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides a restart command for Deployment and StatefulSet resources in Helm charts. Users can access this action directly from the resources graph. When initiated, a banner appears in the resource details to track the restart operation's progress.

### Other changes

* *Improvement* - Apollo's Entities tab now features a **K8s Namespace** field in the histogram, allowing users to filter Entities by Kubernetes namespace. The Kubernetes namespace filter can be included in the URL parameters to automatically select the filters on page load.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now intelligently manages the display of the Product description widget on the Releases tab. When no description is set, the widget is hidden for users without edit permissions, optimizing screen space. Users with edit permissions will see an empty widget with a prompt to add a description.
* *Improvement* - The Environment suppression banner now exclusively shows Environment-level suppressions, while the Entity-level suppression banner continues to display both Environment and Entity-level suppressions. This update enhances the visibility of suppression information.
* *Improvement* - Maintenance window override banners are now displayed on Environment and Entity pages. When a maintenance window is active, users can view a banner notification and select the right side popover for more details. If both suppression windows and maintenance windows are active simultaneously, the suppression window takes priority in the display, with maintenance window information available in a collapsed format.
* *Improvement* - When searching in your notifications inbox for items that do not exist, your currently selected item will now remain visible. A new visual guide now appears when you have no notifications, providing clearer direction.
* *Improvement* - The Environment suppressions table features a new type-based filtering feature. Users can refine their view by selecting from various suppression categories, including `Manual`, `Automatic - Failed Plan`, `Automatic - Failed Blue Green Upgrade`, and `Automatic - Release Promotion`.
* *Improvement* - The target version selector for issuing commands now offers expanded metadata for Entity commands. Users can view recall status, recent blue-green upgrade green version information, and total Entity count across Environments. When selecting a version, intermediate Releases are listed with the same comprehensive metadata.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now provides a unified experience for deleting maintenance windows. When removing maintenance windows from blocking conditions, a confirmation dialog displays the number of windows to be deleted. Additionally, a tooltip now appears when all blocking maintenance windows have already ended, providing clearer status information across Environments and Entities.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now prevents deletion of Artifact Registries that are still reported in Environments, avoiding potential errors. The user interface has been enhanced to show all Environments where a registry is reported in the registry's assigned Environments list. Additionally, Environments now display registries that are reported but not assigned, with the option to add them back through change requests.
* *Improvement* - Users can now select a cloud account when installing Terraform modules. The field automatically populates with available accounts. If account information cannot be retrieved, a text input field is provided instead. This field is required to complete the installation process.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays short descriptions in the headers of Environment and Product pages. Users can add and edit these descriptions through the resource metadata settings. Additionally, a README field has been added to resource metadata settings, and the Product README field has been generalized to work with all resource types.
* *Improvement* - Entities now support a new action to cancel active Plans. Users can access this feature through the Entity actions menu, which opens a dialog to cancel any ongoing automatic operations. The dialog includes a rationale text box for documenting cancellation reasons and an option to automatically open a suppression window (enabled by default). A notification appears if no active Plans are found for the Entity.
* *Improvement* - The Module **Contents** tab now displays both a graph representation and the contents inbox in a single view. Users can resize these views by dragging the divider between them. This integrated approach replaces the previous separate Graph tab, allowing for easier visualization of Module composition while maintaining access to the contents list.
* *Fix* - Apollo now automatically refreshes Team information after changes, eliminating the need for manual page reloads. This enhancement ensures immediate visibility of updates to Slack channels, emails, and PagerDuty contacts in the Team details.

This feature includes built-in safeguards, such as permission verification, installation status checks, and parent Module dependency validation, ensuring safe and controlled deletion processes.
* *Improvement* - Introduced enhanced functionality for managing maintenance windows directly from the settings page. Users can access a new edit action that redirects to the Environment configuration, with the maintenance window block pre-selected for immediate modifications. This update extends to both no-downtime and downtime maintenance items, allowing for quick navigation to specific sub-properties within the maintenance window section.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays maintenance window banners for Environments, showcasing all active suppression windows. This update improves clarity in high-traffic environments. Additionally, users can now select the Apollo Entity IDs to view the Entity page, facilitating easier navigation within the platform.
* *Improvement* - Apollo now displays error messages for disconnected Artifact Registries directly in a tooltip when hovering over the registry. This enhancement provides users with immediate feedback on connection issues, streamlining troubleshooting efforts.
* *Improvement* - Added validation to enforce timezone specification when defining maintenance windows in Product settings. This validation ensures that maintenance windows are properly configured, preventing submission errors and improving scheduling accuracy.
* *Improvement* - Introduced a revamped Teams view featuring an inbox component design. This update includes a dedicated **Notifications** tab and consolidates existing features into a comprehensive **Overview** tab. This new **Overview** tab incorporates Membership, Team Properties, Labels, and Roles widgets. Team selection now utilizes the inbox panel, replacing the previous dropdown in the header.
* *Fix* - We've optimized the blue/green event overflow list functionality for small screens, addressing several user interface improvements. The update eliminates excessive scrolling by collapsing items, removes the display of `0 more events` when no additional events exist, and ensures complete visibility of event titles.

## 2024-11-26

### Introducing Artifact Registries

Apollo now supports directly integrating with your existing OCI registry to allow the management and deployment of software directly from your registry. Rather than publishing containers for Product Releases directly to Apollo's Container Registry, you can link your existing OCI registry to Apollo and create Product Releases in Apollo that reference artifacts from your own OCI Registry.

[Learn more about Artifact Registries.](/docs/apollo/managing-artifact-registries/overview/)

***

## 2024-07-08

### Improvements to promotion pipelines

This update introduces improvements to how you can [configure promotion pipelines](/docs/apollo/managing-release-channels/configure-promotion-pipeline/).

Apollo now supports **dynamic Environment strategies** for promotion pipelines. With these strategies, Apollo evaluates conditions on a dynamic set of Environments, chosen with filters. To enable this, you can select **Canary promotion** when configuring a promotion stage.

[Learn more about canary promotion stages.](/docs/apollo/managing-release-channels/configure-promotion-pipeline/#canary-promotion-stage)

***

## 2024-06-13

### Risk management improvements

This update introduces several improvements to how you can [view and manage vulnerabilities](/docs/apollo/managing-vulnerabilities/overview/).

Apollo now differentiates between **vulnerabilities**, which may impact many resources, and **findings**, which are surfaced through scans and identify the specific resource where a vulnerability was found. Each table in the Risk Management applications will only surface a vulnerability once.

#### Risk Management application

The Risk Management application enables you view all the active vulnerabilities detected in Product Releases on your Apollo Hub. You can select vulnerabilities to view information such as risk scores, paths to files that contain the vulnerability, fix versions, and affected Entities.

In addition to the global context, the Risk Management application is also available in the context of a specific Environment through the Environment **Security** tab.

You can also use the Risk Management application to [create suppressions for vulnerabilities](/docs/apollo/managing-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-suppressions/).

#### Suppression scopes

When [suppressing a vulnerability](/docs/apollo/managing-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-suppressions/#creating-vulnerability-suppressions) that has multiple findings, you can now set a suppression scope that defines what findings Apollo will suppress. You can suppress findings on a specific image, image prefix, or for the distribution bundle of a Product. You can also suppress the finding across all deployed Products.

Additionally, we have made updates to core workflows of requesting a suppression, identifying other affected resources, and re-running vulnerability scans after creating a suppression.

***

## 2024-06-11

### Improvements to secret creation

This update introduces several improvements to how you can manage secrets in Apollo.

You can now create secrets for an Entity at installation time. To do this, use the new **Add secrets** option in the Entity installation form. Apollo will create the secret in the Environment when it installs the Entity.

When editing secrets, you can now view existing secret keys. In addition, you can now change some key-value pairs in a secret without modifying others.

### Improvements to Modules workflows

This update introduces several improvements to how you update and manage [Module](/docs/apollo/core/modules/) installations in your Environments.

#### Update Module installations

After you [edit a Module](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/create-module/#edit-a-module), Apollo will now automatically attempt to update all installations of the Module. You can view the available updates for each installation of the Module in the **Installations** tab of the Module overview page.

You can also update a Module installation manually by following same steps as when [installing a Module](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/install-module/).

[Learn more about updating Module installations](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/update-module-installation/).

#### Mark Entities for uninstallation

You can now mark Entities for uninstallation in the Module YAML file:

```yml
markedForUninstallation:
    minVersion: 1.0.0
    unmanageAfterUninstall: AUTOMATIC
```

Marking the Entity for uninstallation in the Module definition will ensure that the Entity is uninstalled from the Environment when the Module is updated. If you simply remove the Entity from the Module definition, the Entity will not be uninstalled from the Environment when the Module is updated.

#### Unlink Modules

You can now unlink a Module from an Environment to remove the Module installation. The Entities that were part of the Module will remain in the Environment after the Module is unlinked but will no longer be managed by the Module.

[Learn more about unlinking Modules](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/install-module/#unlinking-a-module).

### Product Release incompatibilities

Apollo now supports Product Release incompatibilities. This allows you to declare that a Product Release is incompatible with a range of other Product Releases. Apollo will ensure that Product Releases that are incompatible with each other are not installed in the same Environment at the same time.

You can define Product Release incompatibilities in the Product Release manifest:

```yml
extensions:
  product-incompatibilities:
   - product-group: org.postgresql
     product-name: postgresql
     product-type: helm-chart
     minimum-version: 9.3.6
     maximum-version: 9.6.x
```

[Learn more about configuring Product Release incompatibilities](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/product-incompatibilities/).

### Experimental Apollo CLI commands

This update introduces [Experimental](/docs/apollo/apollo-references/developer-api-limited-support-policies/#experimental) commands for the following Apollo resources:

* [Entities](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_entity/)
* [Environments](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_environment/)
* [Modules](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_module/)
* [Product Releases](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli-deprecated/apollo-cli_get-product-releases/)

[View an example end-to-end workflow using the new commands](/docs/apollo/apollo-references/experimental-end-to-end-workflow/).

To begin using these commands, you can [re-download the Apollo CLI](/docs/apollo/apollo-getting-started/apollo-cli-getting-started/#download-the-cli).

***

## 2024-02-29

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - When [uninstalling Entities](/docs/apollo/managing-entities/uninstalling-and-unmanaging-entities/), users can now optionally enter a title and rationale for the change request that will be created.
* *Improvement* - A warning banner will now appear on an Entity page if the Entity is stuck in `Install pending` state.
* *Fix* - Apollo will now display the full label name for labels with URL values.
* *Fix* - Fixed an issue where default values for a Module did not appear in the **Contents** tab.
* *Fix* - Fixed an issue where the [final step of the Product publishing form](/docs/apollo/managing-products/publishing-helm-charts/#step-3-publish-your-product) would become unresponsive.

***

## 2024-01-31

### Improved Entity uninstallation

This update introduces several improvements to how you uninstall Entities from an Environment in Apollo.

After you uninstall a local Entity, Apollo will unmanage the Entity by removing it from the Environment settings.

For remote Entities, you can uninstall the Entity from the source Hub and then transfer the update in a bundle to the target Hub. After the Entity is uninstalled from the target Hub and you confirm this from the source Hub, Apollo will unmanage the Entity by removing it from the Environment settings.

[Learn more about uninstalling local and remote Entities](/docs/apollo/managing-entities/uninstalling-and-unmanaging-entities/).

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added the **Installations** tab to the [Module page](/docs/apollo/managing-modules/overview/) that displays the version, owner, and date last updated for each installation of the Module in an Environment.
* *Fix* - Fixed an issue where the end date for maintenance window overrides did not update properly.
* *Fix* - Fixed an issue where the [Product publishing workflow](/docs/apollo/managing-products/publishing-helm-charts/#product-publishing-workflow) did not generate the correct command for publishing Helm charts from OCI repositories to Apollo.

***

## 2023-12-14

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added a troubleshooting dialog for failed Plans. Navigate to a failed Plan from the **Activity** tab and select **Troubleshoot failed plan** to view the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/apollo/core/troubleshooting-in-cluster/).
* *Improvement* - Added a banner to the Environment page when there is an active Environment-wide suppression window.
* *Improvement* - Bundle advisories are now displayed while a bundle is building.

***

## 2023-11-15

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Users can view the history for a [promotion without Test Environments](/docs/apollo/managing-release-channels/configure-promotion-pipeline/#timed-promotion-stage) by selecting the [transition node](/docs/apollo/managing-products/tracking-product-releases/#transition-nodes) for a promotion stage.
* *Improvement* - Added the [Environment **Overview** tab](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/overview/) for remote Environments.
* *Improvement* - Users can now specify a timezone for the expiry date when [freezing all version changes](/docs/apollo/recalling-releases/roll-off-strategies/#freeze-all-version-changes) as part of a recall.
* *Improvement* - Users can now add labels to an [Entity](/docs/apollo/managing-labels/entity-labels/) by selecting **Add labels** from the **Label history** table of the **Activity** tab.

***

## 2023-10-15

### Improved recalls

This update introduces several improvements to how you recall Releases in Apollo. To prevent shipping known bugs, users can now issue an open ended recall, and Apollo will auto-recall any new Releases. Users can edit the range of recalled Releases anytime to update the range of recalled Releases.

Users can also recall the same Release for different reasons. Apollo will intelligently resolve multiple recalls for a Release and ensure that Entities are rolled off bad Releases.

Learn more about improved [recalls in Apollo](/docs/apollo/recalling-releases/overview/).

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Changes to a Product's settings will now be shown in the **Changes** tab of the Product home page.
* *Fix* - Removed the co-owner field from the Product details panel.

***

## 2023-09-15

### Environment Overview tab

The first time you navigate to an Environment will land you on the new [Environment **Overview** tab](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/overview/). This tab displays relevant information about an Environment, such as the owner, the default Release Channel, the labels applied to the Environment, and the maintenance windows. You can also view the upgrade status of Entities in the Environment and the status of Apollo Agents deployed in the Environment.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now [apply labels to Teams](/docs/apollo/managing-labels/team-labels/).
* *Improvement* - Users can now manage permissions for Environments and Entities using [role-based access controls (RBAC)](/docs/apollo/core/authorization/).

***

## 2023-08-15

### Activity tab

The **Activity** tab for Entities and Environments allows you to view [Plans](/docs/apollo/core/plans-and-constraints/#plans), [commands](/docs/apollo/managing-entities/user-issued-commands/), and upgrades in a single tab. This tab displays any blocking constraints for ongoing work, as well as the status of completed work.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now be added directly to Apollo [Teams](/docs/apollo/core/teams/).

***

## 2023-07-15

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now filter [change requests](/docs/apollo/managing-changes/change-requests/) by author.
* *Improvement* - View Plans to upgrade Entities to new Releases and any constraints blocking them in the **Upgrades** tab of the Entity home page.

***

## 2023-06-15

### Labels for Entities and Environments

This update introduces labels for [Entities](/docs/apollo/managing-labels/entity-labels/) and [Environments](/docs/apollo/managing-labels/environment-labels/). Add labels to these resources to tag with them information that is key to your organization or software operations. Then, use labels to filter the list of Entities or Environments based on specific properties.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added support for [deleting Products and Product Releases](/docs/apollo/managing-products/delete-product-and-product-release/) in Apollo.

***

## 2023-05-15

### Promote up to chosen channel

This feature provides a single workflow entry point to manually add a Release to a Release Channel. With this [manual promotion workflow](/docs/apollo/managing-release-channels/manual-promotion/), the break-glass operation of adding a Release to a Release Channel scales to match the ability to configure complex promotion pipelines.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added support for AgentIds to be arbitrary strings.
* *Improvement* - Added date range filters to the Change Request page. Users can filter by the date and time that a change request was created or last updated.

***

## 2023-04-30

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Users can now reference user-defined secrets in [Helm chart config overrides](/docs/apollo/managing-entities/set-config-overrides/#config-for-helm-charts). Secret changes will appear as a Plan for an Entity.
* *Improvement* - Added a filter to Release table on a Product overview page. Users can filter the list of Releases by Release Channel or recall status.
* *Fix* - The **Upgrade** tab of the Entity overview page now specifies the required maintenance window, either downtime or no-downtime, when an upgrade is blocked.

***

## 2023-03-31

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added status and rollout bars that display the number of Entities that are up to date, currently upgrading, in grace period, and blocked.

***

## 2023-02-28

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Improved functionality of the suppressions table, adding indicator for out of date suppressions, filtering, sorting, and bulk actions.
* *Improvement* - Added the **Changes** tab on the Product overview page where users can view change requests for that Product.
* *Improvement* - Users can now [add and edit labels](/docs/apollo/managing-labels/product-release-labels/) on a Release by selecting **Edit labels** from the **Actions** dropdown.
* *Improvement* - Improved the messages displayed when a Release is recalled.
* *Improvement* - Improved the way promotion constraint results, such as Product maintenance windows and health status checks, are surfaced to users.
* *Improvement* - Added filters to the Environments table. Users can now filter the list of Environments by owner, accreditation, namespace, or label.

***

## 2023-01-31

### Environment Config

This update adds support for managed Environment Configs to Apollo.

Common configuration values, such as domain names, may be useful across many Entities in an Environment. Prior to this update, these shared values had to be provided to Entities through bespoke systems in your Environment, or stored many times in each Entity Config in Apollo. Either solution meant more work for Environment owners and less clear visibility into shared values.

Apollo now supports managed Environment Config through a similar workflow as available for each Entity. These values are also represented in each Entity Config tab to make sure every operator in the Environment knows about them and Pans for each Entity include both Config values. Changes to these values go through standard Change Management processes, and updates are propagated to each Entity through rolling Plans across the Environment.

### Improved Release Promotion Graph

Promotion Stages between Release Channels support flexible rollout strategies across environments for your products. To make it easier to manage these promotion stages, the Release "Canary Analysis" tab has been replaced with comprehensive "Promotion" workflows.

The Promotion Graph clarifies the representation of complex branching pipelines in the Apollo interface and makes it easier to interpret the observations that led to automated action. Interactive components now provide in-context answers to key questions about automated recall, pending upgrades, in-flight promotion constraints, and more.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Moved the product "History" tab to the main "Details" view to simplify navigation.
* *Improvement* - Added tooltips explaining how suppressions applied to environments impact plan recommendation.
* *Improvement* - Added a new graphic to the **Bundler** landing page to explain bundling workflows to new users.
* *Improvement* - Added a default namespace feature that automatically lands the user on their last viewed namespace upon navigating to the bundler.
* *Improvement* - Improved Change Request rejection messages for users when one or more requirements are disapproved.
* *Improvement* - Enabled sharable links for bundles.
* *Improvement* - Improved styling and legibility for warnings encountered during remote bundling workflows.
* *Improvement* - Improved warnings for users when the reported state from an environment for an entity is out of date.
* *Improvement* - Cleaned up indentation on bundle contents page and sorted contents by version.
* *Improvement* - Dynamically rendered the bundler menu popover depending on a user’s access to the bundler, unbundler, or both.
* *Fix* - Added pagination to view bundles past the most recent fifty that had been built.

***

## 2022-12-16

### New Admin Permissions Panel

There is now a Permissions panel in Settings that provides visibility into the roles that exist for each context and who they are granted to. Previously, root role grants for various resource types in Apollo were inaccessible to end-users, requiring Palantir intervention to set appropriate admin teams or groups for each context. Now, root admins can use the Permissions panel to independently set access for roles.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added sort and search capabilities to the list of products bundled to a remote namespace.
* *Improvement* - Improved styling for common inbox components reused through the application.
* *Fix* - Addressed performance problems with rationale inputs in break-glass commands.
* *Fix* - Fixed various data consistency or status representation problems in bundler workflow.

* *Fix* - Prevent the application from crashing when expanding details for a plan that impacts multiple entities.

***

## 2022-10-31

### Environment Templates

Environments managed by Apollo must include a well-defined set of control plane services; the "Create Environment" workflow now contains a set of predefined options for your control plane. These options help operators make an informed decision about which services are relevant to a use case and prevent problems with misconfigured environments.

### Other Changes

* *Deprecation* - Migrated and removed legacy release labels to prepare for modern user-driven release labels.
* *Improvement* - Added a dialog walking through the release registration process to support "New Product" workflows.

### Scanning for Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability scanning is critical for modern software security: given the number of open source components most software products use, discovered vulnerabilities will affect most product releases eventually. We are deeply integrating security scanning and scan result visibility into Apollo to help.

Product releases now have a "Security" tab that provides in-context access to results. Severe vulnerabilities will be subject to automatic release recall. This information is made visible for all operators to help them pinpoint in exactly which Products and Environments active vulnerabilities are deployed.

### Environment Setup Guide

To make it easier for first-time Apollo users to manage an environment, we have introduced a dedicated in-app walkthrough to guide new environment owners through the steps required to connect an Apollo agent. This update also includes new manifest generation capabilities and a clear workflow to enable self-service setup for new users.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Updated Products views to show the Releases tab by default.
* *Improvement* - Supported deleting and restoring multiple Entities at once within an Environment.
* *Improvement* - Improved "restore" workflows for managed Entities after deletion.
* *Improvement* - Added support for break-glass commands for Helm Charts.
* *Improvement* - Added automatic refresh for plans lists so that users don't need to re-load the page manually.
* *Improvement* - Added environment namespace filters to the main Environment list.
* *Improvement* - Improved the styling and clarity for links to all entity types.
* *Improvement* - Improved the displayed statuses for break-glass commands executed by users in Apollo.
* *Improvement* - Provided a quick-copy button for key identifiers for Apollo concepts in details panels.
* *Improvement* - Added the "Override Maintenance Window" action to the individual Entity actions dropdown.
* *Fix* - Added more validations to Environment names during create workflows.
* *Fix* - Ensured capitalization is consistent for Release Channel names across the application.
* *Fix* - Ensured Change Request pop-up windows always link directly to the change request.

***

## 2022-07-29

### Settings Approvals

Creating new environments or products along with many other settings updates were only possible for users with highly privileged administrative control within an Apollo organization. These changes are now all possible through the Change Request system. Any user can propose changes to settings, and the policy engine controls determine whether those actions are auto-approved or require a specific approval.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Switched the bottom drawer in the entity list to closed by default.
* *Improvement* - Updated the icons for core concepts in all usages across the application.
* *Improvement* - Ensured consistent styling for team, environment, and product lists.
* *Improvement* - Improved Install Map styles and colors.

## 2022-07-01

### Product Settings & Navigation

Ownership, promotion, and rollout settings for products can now be configured directly from the products list. These changes previously required navigating to a separate settings page. That page has been removed now that there is a clearer entrypoint.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added rows for environments "pending creation" in the main navigation list after change request approval.
* *Improvement* - Removed the left entity sidebar in favor of a smaller right details panel.
* *Improvement* - Simplified the new entity dialog by moving some settings into an "advanced" section.
* *Improvement* - Introduced a simpler version-only input for initial entity config overrides.
* *Fix* - Switched to a bulk endpoint for entity health data to improve user-perceived latency.

***

## 2022-06-17

### Apollo Home Page

We've added a new default landing page to Apollo, focused on providing more information about key Apollo concepts. In particular, this landing page describes Environments, products, and teams - concepts that Apollo users must understand and configure when getting started with the platform.

### Apollo Public Documentation

You're reading this on the new public Apollo documentation site! Apollo's documentation will provide descriptions of core concepts, tutorials, and developer-focused specifications, and will be connected to the Apollo platform to provide specific help or context where appropriate.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added a dropdown for supported versions of products to deploy during entity creation.
* *Improvement* - Moved some non-required fields to an "Advanced" form section in entity creation.
* *Improvement* - Added a "details" panel to install page.
* *Improvement* - Added Helm chart details to product release view.
* *Improvement* - Added a "details" panel to product release route.
* *Improvement* - Moved product settings into the primary product navigation list rather than the settings panels.
* *Improvement* - Introduced config actions to the environment's Actions button as a dialog.
* *Fix* - Added environment downtime approval constraints for break-glass commands with impact on quorum.
* *Fix* - Improved end-user perceived latency in the installation health inboxes.
* *Fix* - Fixed environments list scroll layout, sort alphabetically.

***

## 2022-06-10

### The Payload Bundler

Many Apollo-supported installations of software are *only* accessible from specific air-gapped secure networks with strict data controls. That means that new releases of Apollo products need to go through a special process in order to be deployed into these environments.

Apollo supports this process through an application now available in the primary sidebar navigation called the **Payload Bundler**. Namespace owners are the primary users of the Payload Bundler: software operators who use Apollo to make sure the environments in these secure spaces are healthy and up-to-date. They can easily prepare and manage "bundles" of software with prepared updates for all tracked environments in a remote namespace. Apollo ensures these bundles contain the releases, settings, and metadata that are critical to keeping these critical applications and environments working.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Added the Namespace Details Panel to the Namespace Settings list to provide quick read-only access to key namespace properties.
* *Improvement* - Added the "Create Environment" button to the main environment list, in addition to the "Settings" environment list.
* *Improvement* - Made all environment settings actions available through menu options within the "Actions" button for an environment.
* *Improvement* - Moved environment suppression and maintenance window override controls into menu options within the "Actions" button for an environment.
* *Improvement* - Added an environment and namespace filter control to the main environment list.
* *Improvement* - Added options for "Additional requirements" for Change Request reviewers to power more complex compliance policies.
* *Fix* - Removed a duplicate scrollbar on the environment list and sort alphabetically by default.

## 2022-05-27

### Team Membership Clarity

[Authorization](/docs/apollo/core/authorization/) in Apollo is based on the concept of [Teams](/docs/apollo/core/teams/). To make it easier to determine the team responsible for Products, Environments, or Installations, we have improved the interface for viewing a user's identity and team membership. The user settings page now includes a **Profile & Preferences** panel where you can see all teams for which the current user is a member or administrator. Additionally, the navigation sidebar now provides quick access to the full logged-in user ID, a logout button, and a link to the **Profile & Preferences** settings panel.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Improved Helm Chart upgrade and rollback behavior, especially for failure cases due to container availability problems.
* *Improvement* - Added a count to indicate the number of pending changes on the changes tab for environment and entity views.
* *Improvement* - Added a "session expired" dialog to guide the user to log in again when their login token expires.
* *Improvement* - Added a column to represent the number of entities on an environment from within the primary navigation list.
* *Improvement* - Added an option to group environments by namespace in the primary environment list.
* *Improvement* - Added the Product Details Panel to Product Settings list and Product Page views to show the product group, ownership, on-call, and key stats about the product.
* *Improvement* - Added a user profile popover to the main navigation sidebar. This popover provides one-click access to log-out of Apollo.
* *Improvement* - Added the Team Details Panel to Team Settings list and Team Page views. This panel clearly displays both group and individual roles for the team.
* *Fix* - Distinguished upgrade plans from config changes for pending plans in the upgrade tab of single entity views.

### Modernized Sidebar Navigation

We've introduced an improved sidebar navigation component. This component contains quick links to all of the key concepts, owned environments, key tools or settings, and more.

### Other Changes

* *Improvement* - Moved the filters in the Change Request inbox from top to left to better handle a large number of filter options.
* *Improvement* - Added an indicator for overall entity health status through a colored icon on the health tab.
* *Improvement* - Simplified and standardized resource headers within the application.
* *Improvement* - Cleaned up many polish or usability issues with the primary navigation sidebar.
* *Fix* - Improved long loading times on installation-specific change request views.
* *Fix* - Stopped using color on entire rows in installation tables to better draw attention to more actionanable status indicators in the row.
