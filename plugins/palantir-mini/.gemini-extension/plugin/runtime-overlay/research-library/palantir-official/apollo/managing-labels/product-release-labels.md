# Product Release labels

You can apply labels to Product Releases to tag them with relevant information and define requirements for promotion. For example, you can create a label that is added to Releases that have been scanned and approved and require that all Releases have this label before being promoted to a certain Release Channel.

## Apply labels to Product Releases

Apply labels to a Product Release by navigating to the Product Release overview page and selecting the **Edit labels...** option from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

![The Edit labels button in the Actions dropdown is highlighted.](/docs/resources/apollo/managing-labels/edit-labels-button.png)

This will open a menu where you can manage labels for the Product Release. You can view the labels that have been applied in the **Applied** section. You can select labels to apply to the Product Release from the **More** section.

After choosing the label, you can select the pencil icon on the right of the label and enter a value.

When you are finished, select **Apply** to save your changes.

## Label requirements for Release promotion

You can use labels to define conditions that a Release must satisfy before being added to a Release Channel. These conditions are called **label requirements**. When a Release Channel has label requirements defined, all Releases must satisfy these requirements to be admitted to the Release Channel. There are two types of label requirements:

* A label ID that must exist on the Product Release regardless of the label value. For example, you can set a requirement that all Product Releases have the label ID `apollo-product-definition-available` to be admitted to a Release Channel.
* A label ID and value pair can be enforced. For example, you can require Product Releases to have a label with ID `scanned-and-approved` and value `true` to be admitted to a Release Channel.
