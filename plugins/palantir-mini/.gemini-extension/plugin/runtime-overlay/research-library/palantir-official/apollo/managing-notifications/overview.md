# Notifications

Apollo notifications allow you to receive updates about your Products, Environments, and teams. With Apollo notifications, you can:

* Receive updates through multiple channels: email, Slack, or the Apollo platform
* Configure notifications at both user and team levels
* Customize notification preferences to match your workflow

This section will guide you through managing notifications in Apollo.

## Notification recipients

* [Team notifications](/docs/apollo/managing-notifications/team-notifications/): Notifications are configured for a team and will be received by all members of the team.
* [User notifications](/docs/apollo/managing-notifications/user-notifications/): Notifications are configured for a user and will be received by the specific user.

## Notification targets

You can configure notifications for the following targets:

* Email: Send notifications to a user or team email address
* Slack: Send notifications to a team Slack channel
* In-app: Receive notifications directly in the Apollo platform

## Notification types

The following are examples of notification types supported in Apollo. These examples are non-comprehensive and the supported types will grow over time.

* Change requests: Receive notifications for change requests pending approval from your team.
* Change request summary: Receive a daily summary of change requests pending approval from your team.
* Product recalls: Receive notifications when an open-ended recall is issued for a Product.
* RBAC changes: Receive notifications for when RBAC permissions are changed on resources.
* Promotion failures: Receive notifications when Release Channel promotions fail.
* Plan failures: Receive notifications when Plans fail.

## Prerequisites

For team notifications, you must configure a [team contact](/docs/apollo/managing-teams/team-contacts/) for the team that you want to receive notifications.

## FAQ

### How do I get notified about change requests?

Change requests are associated with teams that you are a member of. To receive notifications for change requests pending approval from your team, enable notifications for that team in Hub Settings.

### Is my team automatically subscribed to receive notifications for Products that belong to the team?

Yes, a team will receive notifications for Products if the team is configured as a contact team for the Product. Note that this still respects the notification filter preferences set on the team contact.

### How do I link Apollo with Slack?

Contact your Palantir representative to link Apollo with your Slack organization.

### Does Apollo support custom webhook destinations for notifications?

Custom webhook destinations are not currently supported but are on the development roadmap. Contact your Palantir representative to learn more.

### Why do email and Slack notifications only have a link to the Apollo platform?

Notifications are permissioned so that only users who can view the underlying resources will receive notifications. Data leaving the boundary poses compliance and security risks, so Apollo shows limited information by default. To receive more detailed notifications, contact your Palantir representative.
