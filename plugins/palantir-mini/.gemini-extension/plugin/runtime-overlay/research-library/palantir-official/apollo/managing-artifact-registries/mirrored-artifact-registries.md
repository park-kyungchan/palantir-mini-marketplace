# Mirrored Artifact Registries

:::callout{theme="warning"}
It is unlikely that you will need to use Mirrored Registries, except under specific circumstances. Review this section carefully to ensure correct usage.
:::

Apollo supports the ability to define **Mirrored Registries**, which tell Apollo that an Artifact Registry that is defined "mirrors" another registry. Any time Apollo needs to pull a container from the Mirrored Registry, it will instead pull the container from the defined Artifact Registry.

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Setting the same Mirrored Registry on multiple Artifact Registries is allowed, but this is undefined behavior. A single **Artifact Registry** will be chosen from the overlapping **Artifact Registries**.
:::

## Example use case

Consider the following scenario to understand the use case for Mirrored Registries:

* You have an internal OCI registry accessible only from within your organization's network, say `internal.registry.com`. This hosts all your container images that get deployed to your own infrastructure via a Helm chart.
* This Helm chart explicitly sets `internal.registry.com` as the registry from which to pull images.
* You do not want to expose this internal registry to Apollo, so you create another OCI registry `external.registry.com`. This external registry is exposed to Apollo, and contains the Helm chart and necessary container images for Apollo to deploy to your Environments.
* You create a Product in Apollo that uses the Helm chart `external.registry.com/charts/foo/bar:1.0.0`.

In this scenario, you would want to create the following Artifact Registry:

![Example Mirrored Artifact Registry, with the URL being external.registry.com and the Mirrored Registry being internal.registry.com](/docs/resources/apollo/managing-artifact-registries/artifact-registry-example-mirrored-registry.png)

Now, your Helm chart `external.registry.com/charts/foo/bar:1.0.0` will be pulled from the `external.registry.com` OCI registry. When you install this Helm chart that references the container image `internal.registry.com/foo/bar:1.0.0` into an Environment, Apollo will instead pull the image from the `external.registry.com` Artifact Registry.
