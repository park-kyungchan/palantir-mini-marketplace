# Configure Environment edit source

The Environment's edit source determines where the Environment's settings, such as its Entities, configs, or Artifact Registries, can be modified.
Environment editors can switch the edit source at any time.

## Edit source options

### Edit on this Hub

You can edit the Environment's settings directly in the current Hub. This Hub is the authoritative source for the Environment's configuration.
When a new Environment is created, it is set to "Edit on this Hub" by default. This ensures an Environment's settings cannot be unintentionally overwritten when importing a bundle from another Hub.

**Characteristics:**

* The Environment's settings can be modified in this Hub.
* The Environment can be exported to another Hub along with its settings.
* If you import a bundle that would overwrite this Environment's settings, it will be rejected with the error `InvalidTargetDeclaredStateSource` or `CannotImportInEnvironmentWithAuthoritativeDeclaredStateSource`. If you decide you want to import the Bundle anyway, you must first [switch the edit source](#switching-edit-source) to "Edit on another Hub" and then import the bundle again.

### Edit on another Hub

The Environment's settings are managed in another Hub. This Hub is not the authoritative source for the Environment's configuration.
To edit the Environment's settings, you must go to the upstream Hub, edit the Environment settings there, and then import the changes via a bundle to this Hub.
When an Environment is imported into a Hub for the first time, it is set to "Edit on another Hub" based on the export options selected.

**Characteristics:**

* The Environment's settings cannot be modified in this Hub.
* Environment settings are imported from another Hub via bundles.
* Some Entity configs may be modified in this Hub if the upstream Hub allows it.
* Individual Entity configs can be modified in this Hub for break-glass scenarios.
* The Environment can be exported to another Hub along with its settings.

### Copy of another Hub

The Environment's settings are a copy of another upstream Hub. This Hub is not the authoritative source for the Environment's configuration.
When an Environment is imported into a Hub for the first time, it is set to "Copy of another Hub" based on the export options selected.
This option is suitable for creating read-only views of Environments connected to other Hubs.
In the event of an outage in the other Hub, you can reconnect the Environment to this Hub and switch the edit source to "Edit on this Hub" while maintaining its settings.

**Characteristics:**

* The Environment's settings cannot be modified in this Hub.
* Environment settings are imported from another Hub via bundles.
* Entity config cannot be modified in this Hub even if the upstream Hub allows it.
* Individual Entity config cannot be modified in this Hub for break-glass scenarios.
* The Environment can be exported to another Hub along with its settings.

## Manage edit source

### View current edit source

The current edit source for an Environment is shown in the Environment header.

### Switching edit source

1. Navigate to your Environment.
2. Select **Switch edit source** from the **Actions** dropdown.
3. Choose the new connection setting:
   * **Edit on this Hub**: Enable editing of the Environment's settings in this Hub.
   * **Edit on another Hub**: Disable editing of the Environment's settings in this Hub. Settings will be imported from another Hub.
   * **Copy of another Hub**: Disable editing of the Environment's settings in this Hub. Settings will be imported from another Hub and cannot be modified even for break-glass scenarios.
4. Confirm and apply the changes.
