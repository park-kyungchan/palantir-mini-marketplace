# Troubleshooting in Kubernetes clusters

Apollo leverages core Kubernetes and Helm APIs to make changes to the deployed resources in your environment. Apollo gathers much of the information centrally in your Hub to help you operate at scale across clusters. However, Apollo is not intended to be a full replacement for in-cluster tools and expertise. You will eventually need to debug why something is going wrong.

The goal of this guide is to highlight the key commands that are useful in your cluster when troubleshooting problems with your Apollo-managed Helm charts. This is not an exhaustive list, it is intended to be a jumping off point that connects you to valuable resources outside of Apollo.

## Kubernetes

You should be familiar with the Kubernetes basics before you start using Apollo. We recommend reviewing the [Concepts ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) pages, and trying out some of the [Kubernetes tutorials ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) first. You can also refer to the [kubectl Cheat Sheet ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) for more information on the commands.

The goal of this guide is to help point you in the right direction when troubleshooting problems when managing Helm charts with Apollo.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
The core Kubernetes documentation recommends using [minikube ↗](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) when learning about Kubernetes. This works for basic cases, but has limitations that make it more challenging to use Apollo. We recommend that you use [kind configured as a basic multi-node cluster](/docs/apollo/core/set-up-local-kubernetes-cluster/).

### Get pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -—all-namespaces

NAMESPACE             NAME                                   READY STATUS  RESTARTS AGE
default               wordpress-57577c7cf9-99b8t             1/1   Running 0        3h33m
default               wordpress-mariadb-0                    1/1   Running 0        3h33m

```

### Describe pod

We recommend using the `kubectl describe pod` view information about a pod. The `Events` section at the end of the output can help you debug startup failures if your pod is in a state of `Pending`, `CreateContainerConfigError`, or `ImagePullBackOff`.

```bash
kubectl describe pod wordpress-584d8d7dbf-gflrl

### Pod logs

Apollo assumes that you have your own way to access logs for your running pods. These logs are often critical to troubleshooting problems with your deployed Helm charts. These logs will not be surfaced in Apollo. Apollo will only show information emitted from Helm or Kubernetes. If your pods started and is in a state of `Error` or `CrashLoopBackOff`, you should review the pod logs to diagnose the issue.

If you have at least read access to kubectl in-cluster, you can run `kubectl logs` using the appropriate pod by `NAME` from the `kubectl get pods` command above.

Note that you can use additional flags like `--since` to limit outputs to more recent and relevant log outputs.

```bash
kubectl logs wordpress-584d8d7dbf-gflrl --since 1m

## Debug running pods

The Kubernetes documentation contains a guide on how to [jump into and debug pods ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/) of various shapes. There is a lot of variety depending on how you have set up your containers, so we recommend reviewing this guide to identify the right tools for your environments.

### Get services

Services are how you allow traffic to your containers, in cluster or externally. If you want to access a website you deployed with a Helm chart, you will need to know the appropriate IP addresses to use to do so. The `kubectl get svc` command will help find that IP address, or tell you if it is missing.

```bash
kubectl get svc

NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
kubernetes                ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                      104m
metallb-webhook-service   ClusterIP      10.96.49.198    <none>        443/TCP                      23m
wordpress                 LoadBalancer   10.96.31.110    <pending>     80:32314/TCP,443:32281/TCP   20m
wordpress-mariadb         ClusterIP      10.96.200.146   <none>        3306/TCP                     20m
```

## Common issues and troubleshooting

Some Helm charts assume things about your Kubernetes environments for the Helm chart to work properly. Ultimately, this is an issue with the Helm Chart, the environment it is deployed into, or the way that it has been configured. You must choose how to resolve these issues in each of your environments and Helm charts.

This section documents some common problems you may run into, with a recommendation for what to do about it. It is important to remember that these are just starting point options and you must determine the right resolution.

### Missing LoadBalancer

A common problem that you may run into is the assumption that a LoadBalancer exists in the environment already. This is provided for you if you are running your Helm chart in a hyperscaler cloud Kubernetes environment like [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) ↗](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs), [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) ↗](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/), or [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) ↗](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/).

This is a cloud provider offering that will allocate IP addresses to your services. If you are using kind as we recommend for local development, you will not have this, and Helm charts like Wordpress will fail to install without adding supporting resources to the environment.

```
Service does not have load balancer ingress IP address: default/wordpress
```

You can choose how to resolve these issues in each of your environments and Helm charts. For a basic local kind cluster, we recommend [deploying a LoadBalancer like MetalLB ↗](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/loadbalancer/).

## Helm charts

Before deploying Helm charts to Apollo, you should be familiar with how Helm charts work generally, and how a specific Helm chart can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster independent of Apollo. We recommend starting with the official [Helm Quickstart Guide ↗](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/). This guide make the connection between what happens in Apollo and what happens in Helm.

Apollo uses Helm to manage Helm chart type [Entities](/docs/apollo/core/entities/) deployed in your environment. This means that as long as you have access to your environment, the same Helm commands you would normally use are still valuable.

### Helm list

```bash
helm list —all

NAME      NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED             STATUS   CHART            APP VERSION
wordpress default   6        2023-11-21 23:00:09 deployed wordpress-18.1.0 6.3.2
```

### Helm Release History

```bash
helm history wordpress

REVISION UPDATED                  STATUS          CHART            APP VERSION DESCRIPTION
1        Tue Nov 21 20:30:27 2023 failed          wordpress-18.1.0 6.3.2       Release "wordpress" failed: timed out waiting for the condition

6        Tue Nov 21 23:00:09 2023 deployed        wordpress-18.1.0 6.3.2       Rollback to 4
```

### Helm get values

```bash
helm get values wordpress

USER-SUPPLIED VALUES:
apollo:
 artifactStoreURIs: {}
 entity:
 id: aeid:test-environment-lrj3:helm-chart:wordpress
 environment:
 id: test-environment-lrj3
 product:
 group: com.example
 name: wordpress
 version: 18.1.0
service.type: NodePort
```

## Environments

If you set up your Apollo Environment with a [local Kubernetes cluster](/docs/apollo/core/set-up-local-kubernetes-cluster/), you should confirm that your agents are successfully reporting to Apollo.
Even though the Pods for the agents are running, they might not be reporting back to Apollo. This will prevent Apollo from issuing Plans for the Environment.

### Reapply manifest

One possible solution to this problem is to reapply the manifest onto your Environment. Navigate to your Environment in Apollo, and find the **Actions** dropdown in the top right. Select **Actions** to open the dropdown, and then select **Environment setup instructions**. Follow the instructions in the dialog. Once you have downloaded and applied the manifest, wait for a minute and reload the page.

### Create a new Environment

If you quit or restarted Docker, or restarted your computer, the agents in your Environment might be unable to reconnect to Apollo. If you have tried the above troubleshooting steps and your agents are still disconnected, you may need to [create a new Environment](/docs/apollo/managing-environments/connect-new-environment/).
