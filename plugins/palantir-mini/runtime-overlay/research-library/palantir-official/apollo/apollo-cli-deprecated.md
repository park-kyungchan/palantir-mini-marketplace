# apollo-cli add-unmanaged-service \[Deprecated]

:::callout{theme="warning"}
This command is [Deprecated](/docs/apollo/apollo-references/developer-api-limited-support-policies/).
This command is deprecated and will be removed in October 2025. Adding unmanaged services is not a recommended practice. Add managed services instead using [apollo-cli entity install](/docs/apollo/apollo-cli/apollo-cli_entity_install/).
:::

Registers an unmanaged service in Apollo

```bash
apollo-cli add-unmanaged-service [flags]
```
