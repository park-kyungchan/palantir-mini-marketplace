# The Apollo Product Full Spec and Definition \[Beta]

The *Apollo Product Specification* defines a way of describing the properties, requirements and expectations of an Apollo product.
The specification provides a simple, concise way to configure a Product that abstracts universal application requirements away from the underlying infrastructure platform (such as Kubernetes).

The specification includes a set of required components which define the intrinsic properties of an application and a set of optional (opt-in) extensions that enable more capabilities of the Spoke Control Plane.

An *Apollo Product Definition* is the definition of a service or application which conforms to the Apollo Product Specification.
An Apollo Product Definition is intended to be versioned alongside a release of an Apollo Product and should be immutable for that Apollo Product Release.

Apollo Product Definitions are organized into different files, each of which have a specific purpose and enumerated Specification [traits](#declaring-product-traits):

* **\[Required] manifest.yml:** Declares the intrinsic properties of an Apollo Product Release. The values of the specification attributes are immutable and cannot be changed later. This file is required for every Apollo Product Definition.
* **\[Optional] configuration.yml:** Declares the default values and behavior of runtime components and capabilities of the specification. These values can be overridden on a per-installation basis within Apollo, and the Apollo Hub is responsible for safely orchestrating the changes. Everything in this file, along with the file itself, are optional.

The individual components of an Apollo Product Definition are packaged into a compressed tarball and sent to Apollo as part of the Apollo Product Release registration process.
Once published, the Apollo Product Definition will be represented as an Apollo Product Release within the Apollo Hub.

> [A working example of an Apollo Product Definition can be found below.](#tying-it-together)

## Declaring product traits

Based on their intended functions, services have different *traits* which describe their behavior or requirements. Traits represent required Product attributes (e.g. required memory allocations, service ports, certs for TLS-based communication) and the implementation of these traits is deferred to the Spoke Control Plane.

The Apollo Product Specification defines a small set of required properties to be defined in all Apollo Product Definitions in the Product's `manifest.yml`, regardless of Product type. These properties allow Apollo to understand how to model a Product Release. See the [manifest specification docs](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/manifest/) for further details.

Below, we will walk through examples of using traits for common requirements of services and how developers can declare those in an Apollo Product Definition.

### Sizing your service

Services need compute resources to function, so the Spoke Control Plane accepts several different compute dimensions from Apollo Product Definitions. These include CPU, memory, and node replication.

#### Declaring your service's compute resources

Service configuration enables developers to define the compute resources each replica of a service needs.
Developers may provide both "requests" (the minimum quantity of a resource a service needs available) and "limits" (the maximum quantity of a resource a service should use) under a top-level `resources` field in the `configuration.yml` file:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 8
    memory: 10Gi
  limits:
    cpu: 16
    memory: 10Gi
```

See the [compute resources specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_resources/) for expected formatting and supported resource types.

#### Replication

Developers can declare the desired number of replicas (pods) of their service in its `configuration.yml` file under the `replication.desired` field:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
replication:
  desired: 3
```

Refer to the [replication specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_replication/) for the complete specification for configuring replication. The Spoke Control Plane will use the resulting replication value when constructing pod controllers for the service.

### Requesting Storage for Your Service

Some services may need to store data to fulfill their responsibilities.
This storage can be requested with volume declarations in an Apollo Product Definition’s `manifest` and `configuration.yml` files.

Developers can declare the names and types of volumes for their product using the `volumes-v2` manifest extension:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  volumes-v2:
    my-volume:
      volume-type:
        durable-volume: {}
    my-other-volume:
      volume-type:
        durable-volume: {}
```

For each entry within the `volumes-v2` manifest extension, developers **must** create a corresponding entry within the top-level `volumes` field in their product's configuration.yml:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
volumes:
  my-volume:
    durable-storage-configuration:
      desired-size: 10G
  my-other-volume:
    durable-storage-configuration:
      desired-size: 5T
```

See [the volumes specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_volumes/) for a full specification of the `volumes-v2` manifest extension and the expected format of a `configuration.yml` file's top-level `volumes` field.

To enable access to a Product's requested volumes, developers can use configuration templating provided by the [Spoke Control Plane's substitution language](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/):

```yaml:
# configuration.yml
conf:
  startup:
    my-data-directory: '{{ volumes.my-volume.PathOnDisk }}'
    my-other-data-directory: '{{ volumes.my-other-volume.PathOnDisk }}'
```

Refer to [Referencing Requested Volumes](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/#referencing-requested-volumes) for more information on referencing volumes in configuration.

### Declaring endpoints

Services may declare the endpoints from which they need to serve networking requests via the `endpoints` field in a product’s `configuration.yml` file:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
endpoints:
  definitions:
    my-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /my-service-endpoint
```

If a configuration defines more than one endpoint, then developers **must** add a field under `endpoints` indicating which endpoint should be used for status (liveness and readiness) checks:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
endpoints:
  sls-status-endpoint: my-service-endpoint
  definitions:
    my-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /my-service-endpoint
```

The Spoke Control Plane expects the status endpoint to serve requests to the `/status/liveness` and `/status/readiness` subpaths. Refer to [liveness and readiness](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_liveness-and-readiness/) specification for more details.

The Spoke Control Plane will use the status endpoint to configure [Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for the service.

To enable accessing defined endpoints in configuration, the Spoke Control Plane's substitution language supports [referencing endpoint definitions](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/#referencing-endpoint-definitions):

```yaml
endpoints:
  definitions:
    my-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8443
      path: /my-endpoint-path
conf:
  server:
    my-endpoint-port: '{{ endpoints.definitions.port }}'
    my-endpoint-path: '{{ endpoints.definitions.path }}'
```

### Enabling Stable Hostnames / Unique Identifier

Some services require that their replicas are individually and deterministically addressable for clients making requests over the network. This could be for leader election or consistent routing of client requests. A product that needs this behavior can include the `require-stable-hostname` extension in its Apollo Product Definition’s `manifest.yml` file:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  require-stable-hostname: true
```

The specification for the `require-stable-hostname` manifest extension is documented as part of the [endpoints specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_endpoints/#manifest-extension-fields).

### Advanced: Receiving Traffic Before your Application is Ready

In rare cases, a service’s replicas need to receive traffic before becoming ready. Products may request this behavior by including the `allow-traffic-when-not-ready` manifest extension:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  allow-traffic-when-not-ready: true
```

The [liveness and readiness specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_liveness-and-readiness/#allow-traffic-when-not-ready-manifest-extension) also documents the `allow-traffic-when-not-ready` manifest extension.

### Exposing your Application to External Traffic

Services often need to serve traffic from outside the cluster (for example, to serve requests from web browsers).
Once endpoints are defined in a service’s `configuration.yml`, developers can declare which of these endpoints should be exposed to external traffic.
Making endpoints externally accessible requires referencing them in an Apollo Product Definition’s manifest under the `public-proxy-endpoints` and `public-tcp-endpoints` extensions:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  public-proxy-endpoints:
    - my-service-endpoint
  public-tcp-endpoints:
    - my-tcp-endpoint
```

Endpoints which receive HTTPS traffic can use `public-proxy-endpoints`. If an endpoint receives raw TCP traffic, it may appear in the `public-tcp-endpoints` extension.

Endpoint definitions whose names appear in the `public-tcp-endpoints` manifest extension **must** include an `external-port` field and **must not** include a `path` field.
Endpoint definitions whose names do not appear in the `public-tcp-endpoints` manifest extension must *not* include the `external-port` field.
Updating the previous endpoints configuration example to make it compatible with the example manifest above yields the following:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
endpoints:
  definitions:
    my-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /my-service-endpoint
    my-tcp-endpoint:
      desired-port: 4567
      external-port: 22
```

The full specification for exposing endpoints to external traffic can be found in the [endpoints specification](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_endpoints/).

## Configuration Management

The Apollo Product Spec is designed to make it easy for developers to build software that is portable, with deployment that doesn’t require manual configuration steps and upgrades that are safe and autonomous. To enable this, Apollo’s Configuration Management focuses on the following sections:

1. Default configuration, defined as part of the Apollo Product Definition, aimed at declaring the configuration a service needs to start and run correctly without requiring manual configuration.
2. How to override and merge specific configuration properties to change the default behavior when necessary.
3. How to map configuration to the files on disk a service expects to read it from.
4. How to automatically generate and manually specifying secrets/IAM credentials for your service.
5. How to make your service discoverable by other services and vice versa.
6. A substitution and templating engine that enables a developer to minimize duplicate references and leverage service management information at runtime.

### Default Configuration

An Apollo Product Definition should include the default configuration of the product, such that the service could be deployed and start correctly without requiring any additional manual configuration. The default configuration is declared in the *configuration.yml* file of the Apollo Production Configuration, under the `conf`  header:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  some-config:
    a: b
    c: d
  some-other-config:
    b: c
    c: d
```

### Configuration Overrides

Occasionally, a service may require configuration overrides to work alongside setups that can’t be predicted in default configuration. This may be for integrating with an external auth provider, changing garbage collection intervals to match atypical usage patterns, or increasing replication in environments under heavy load. The Spoke Control Plane supports defining configuration overrides to be merged on top of an Apollo Product Definition’s original `configuration.yml` contents:

```yaml
# defaults defined in the configuration.yml
conf:
  a: b
  b: c

# overrides defined for a particular instantiation of a service
conf:
  b: overridden
  new-field: now-present

# result of merge
conf:
  a: b
  b: overridden
  new-field: now-present
```

Map merges are performed recursively, meaning that merging array fields or fields of different types will replace the original value with the override’s value. The top-level block for [defining generated secrets](#generating-secrets-at-runtime) **may not** be overridden; this is to protect against outages or data loss resulting from inadvertently overwriting generated secret values.

Configuration overrides should be the exception rather than the rule. See [Configuration Substitution](#configuration-substitution) for how the Spoke Control Plane minimizes the need for configuration overrides.

### Configuration Substitution

The Product Spec provides a simple substitution language that can be used in configuration. Developers can use the substitution language to reference other parts of configuration, or the outputs of the different Spoke Control Plane capabilities offered.

The substitution language leverages double curly brackets (`{{` and `}}`) in configuration to reference other values. The different sections of the Apollo Product Definition can be referenced based on the top level key. The configuration is evaluated and rendered into the final state at runtime by the Spoke Control Plane. As an example:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  some-config:
    a: b
    c: {{ conf.some-other-config.c }}
  some-other-config:
    b: c
    c: d
managed_files:
  some-conf.yml: some-config
```

would result in the following rendered contents:

```yaml
#some-conf.yml:
a: b
c: d
```

In addition to being able to reference other configuration sections, the substitution language has a powerful set of helper functions.

### Managing Configuration Files

Applications and services read configuration from disk in a variety of different file formats and from application specific file names. The Product Spec provides the means for declaring how the configuration declared as part of the Apollo Product Definition should be mapped and rendered to files of different file formats. This is defined in the configuration.yml file of the Apollo Product Definition, under the `managed_files` header:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  some-config:
    a: b
    c: d
  some-other-config:
    b: c
    c: d
managed_files:
  some-conf.yml: some-config
  some-other-conf.json:
    type: json
    content: some-other-config
```

Developers define a file name and the subset of the configuration that should be rendered into the file. By default, all configuration files will get mounted within the `/opt/palantir/services/<product-name>/var/conf` directory of the main container.

Managed file declarations include the following fields:

* `type` \[*required*]: indicates the desired format of the file. Supported values are:
  * `json` - the contents will be rendered as [JSON ↗](https://www.json.org/)
  * `yaml`, `yml` - the contents will be rendered as [YAML ↗](https://yaml.org/)
* `content` \[*required*]: indicates which portion of the conf block should be included in the managed file
* `reload-type` \[*optional*]: indicates whether the service can reload the configuration file without restarting. Accepted values are:
  * `install` \[*default*]: a restart is required to reload the file
  * `runtime`: the file can be reloaded without a restart

The Control supports a shorthand managed file entry, as is done for `some-conf.yml` in the example above, where the file extension for the entry’s key (`.yml`) is used as the managed file’s `type`, and the entry’s value is used as the managed file’s `content`. For entries which use this shorthand, the reload type defaults to `install`. For the above example, the following configuration files would be rendered into the main service container:

```yaml
# some-conf.yml
a: b
c: d

# some-other-conf.json
{"b":"c","c":"d"}
```

### More expansive configuration template support

Some services may not accept configuration file formats described above in [Managing Configuration Files](#managing-configuration-files). For these services, the Spoke Control Plane supports a `tmpl` file type as well:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  my-xml-conf:
    a: b
    b: c
managed_files:
  offroading.xml:
    type: tmpl
```

When using the `tmpl` file type, developers must additionally provide a configuration file template in their Apollo Product Definition within the `deployment/templates` directory:

```generic
|__ deployment
   |__ configuration.yml
   |__ templates
      |__ offroading.xml.tmpl
```

Configuration template files are treated as [Go templates ↗](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and provided the result of configuration substitution as input via the  `{{ .conf }}` template variable. this enables developers to satisfy custom configuration formats while still benefitting from the Spoke Control Plane’s runtime configuration support. An example of using Go templates to produce a valid XML file using the result of substitution is shown below:

```xml
<conf>
  <a>{{ .conf.my-xml-conf.a }}</a>
  <b>{{ .conf.my-xml-conf.b }}</b>
</conf>
```

### Managing Credentials and Secret Material

Some services rely on credentials or other secret material for authentication and authorization with other services. In some instances, this secret material can be randomly generated. To ease the manual configuration burden for these use cases, Apollo supports a variety of options for automatically generating the required secret material by:

* Specifying secrets to generate in a product’s `configuration.yml`. This is useful in the case where a service just needs *some* secret value to establish trust with another service within the cluster.
* Exposing endpoints for administrators to manually define secret values for services. This is useful when a service needs to authenticate a service outside the cluster using some pre-existing credential.

#### Generating secrets at runtime

Specifying secrets that you’d like the Spoke Control Plane to generate on behalf of your service can be done using the top-level `generated_secrets` field in your product’s `configuration.yml` file:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
generated_secrets:
  myAppSecret:
    secret-type: random_string
    length: 24
  myAppRandomByteSecret:
    secret-type: random_bytes
    length: 16
  myAppCustomCharsetSecret:
    secret-type: random_string
    length: 16
    allow-chars: 'abcdefg'
  myAppRsaKeyPair:
    secret-type: rsa_pkcs8
    length: 2048
  myAppStigPassword:
    secret-type: stig_password
  ec_pkcs8:
    secret-type: ec_pkcs8
    length: 2048
```

The Spoke Control Plane generates secret values based on the requested `secret-type` and `length` fields and stores the generated values in [Kubernetes secret objects ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). The following secret types are supported:

* `random_string`: A random string of the provided length (or a default length of 16) will be generated. If the `allow-chars` field is present, the generated secret value will only contain characters which appear in the intersection of the `allow-chars` set and the [base64 ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) charset. Similarly, if the `disallow-chars` field is present, the generated secret value will only contain characters which appear in the set difference of the provided `disallow-chars` set and the base64 charset.
* `rsa_pkcs8`: An RSA [PKCS8 key pair ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_8) of the provided length will be generated.
* `random_bytes`: A cryptographically secure random binary value will be generated. The resulting value will be returned base-64 encoded.
* `ec_pkcs8`: An elliptic curve public/private key pair will be generated. Accepted length values are 224, 256, 384, and 521 (the standard curves defined in [FIPS 186-3 ↗](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/186/3/archive/2009-06-25/documents/fips_186-3.pdf)).

It is highly recommended that the Kubernetes cluster running the Spoke Control Plane is configured to enable [secret encryption at rest ↗](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/).

For cases where services must be provided credentials with pre-defined values, the Hub supports setting user-defined secrets via admin-authorized endpoints.

Services can read in generated and user-defined secrets from configuration using the substitution language’s `secret` method:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  oauth-client:
    id: my-oauth-client-id
    secret: '{{secret("my-oauth-secret")}}'
generated_secrets:
  my-oauth-secret:
    type: random_string
    length: 32
```

See the [Referencing Secrets](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/#referencing-secrets) section for full details on how to reference secrets from substitution.

#### Certificates and CAs

The Spoke Control Plane provides certificates and certificate authority (CA) certs to managed services via a volume mount in the primary service container. This mount encompasses the following files:

* `ca.cer`: A concatenation of all the PEM-encoded certificates which the Deployment Platform is configured to provide as CAs for applications.
* `key.pem`: A private RSA key in PEM format.
* `cert.cer`: The public RSA key for the `key.pem`.
* `truststore.jks`: A Java truststore containing the same set of CAs that appear in `ca.cer`. This file is provided as a convenience for Java applications.
* `keystore.jks`: A Java keystore containing the same private key that appears in `key.pem`. This file is provided as a convenience for Java applications.

See [References Certificate Material](/docs/apollo/apollo-product-specification/hidden_substitution-reference/#referencing-certificate-material-beta) for how to reference these certificate files in configuration.

#### Discovering Services and Config

To ease the manual burden of configuring information that services in a distributed system need to operate correctly, Apollo’s Spoke Control Plane supports a discovery subsystem. Through discovery, services can produce information that can be consumed by other services running in the same environment. This "discovered" information can then be referenced via the configuration subsystem to enable services to reference environment or installation specific configuration information which is only knowable at runtime, without the human toil of configuring it for each environment.

A service produces information associated with a named "role". These discovery entries can then be *consumed* via the same named "role". Discovery production and consumption is declared in an service’s `configuration.yml` file:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  tags:
    - foo

discovery:
  produces:
    my-api:
      role: my-api
      port: 8443
      path: /my-api
      scheme: https
    my-oauth-client:
      role: oauth-client
      client:
        client-id:
        bcryptedOAuthSecret: '{{secret("my-oauth-secret", part: bcrypt_hash)}}'
  consumes:
    neighboring-api:
      role: neighboring-api
      select: uris
      stack: production
      tags: [bar]
```

The Spoke Control Plane supports consuming discovery entries produced by other services, using the following filtering:

* `role`: A discovery entry passes this filter if its role matches that of the `role` field in the consumes entry being evaluated.
* `stack`: The stack in which the discovery entry is produced. By default, a discovery entry is only produced in the stack where the service lives. Discovery can be produced to additional stacks by including a `produce-to-additional-stacks` field under the top-level `discovery` block, in which case it will apply to all entries within a service’s produced discovery. Note that `produce-to-additional-stacks` does not work within an individual discovery entry.
* `tags`: Services can have discovery tags appear on their produced discovery entries by defining a string list under the `conf.tags` key (for instance, the configuration above includes the `foo` tag). By default, consumed discovery filtering accepts any and all tags; if tags are included in a consumes entry (as is the case for the `neighboring-api` entry above), then only discovery entries with all the specified tags pass this filter.

#### Convenience Methods: URI Augmentation

One of the most common use cases of discovery is URI information to enable network requests from one service to another. The Spoke Control Plane simplifies this use case by detecting certain discovery entries to "augment" with URI information. Any discovery entry with a `port` field which is a valid port number will be augmented in this manner. Optional inputs for this augmentation are:

* `scheme`: The scheme of the URI; defaults to `https`
* `path`: The path of the URI; defaults to `/`

The Spoke Control Plane ensures that its discovery augmentation aligns with the URIs as determined by the Kubernetes services it creates on behalf of the service. For example, if a service with the above discovery configuration block has a Kubernetes service with name `foo` and namespace `application-namespace`, then the service's produced `my-api` discovery entry will have its payload augmented to include `uri` and `uris` fields:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
port: 8443
path: /my-api
scheme: https
uri: https:foo.application-namespace.svc.cluster.local:8443/my-api
uris:
  https:foo.application-namespace.svc.cluster.local:8443/my-api
```

##### Selecting Relevant Portions of Produced Discovery

Consuming the above payload directly can be clunky; for instance, developers may care only about the `uris` field when constructing an HTTP client.
To improve discovery ergonomics, the Spoke Control Plane supports defining a `select` field to ‘pick’ a field when consuming discovery. See [tying it together](#tying-it-together) for a working example.

##### Using Consumed Discovery

[Discovering Services and Config](#discovering-services-and-config) covers how to consume discovery produced by other services, but services still need to inject discovered values into the correct portions of their configuration. To that end, the substitution language has a `discovered` method for referencing consumed discovery:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  my-neighbor-client:
    uris: '{{discovered.my-neighbor-api-uris}}'
discovery:
  consumes:
    my-neighbor-api-uris:
      role: my-neighbor-api
      select: uris
```

The above example would result in `conf.my-neighbor-client.uris` being set to a list of URIs crafted from the consumed `ny-neighbor-api` discovery entries.

Self-discovery is also supported:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
conf:
  my-app-uris:
    uris: '{{self_discovered.my-app-uris.uris}}'
discovery:
  produces:
    my-app-uris:
      port: 8080
```

In this example, the port field makes the produced `my-app-uris` role a candidate for [URI augmentation](#convenience-methods-uri-augmentation), so the `conf.my-app-uris.uris` field will have a non-null value.

## Tying It Together

A working example of an Apollo Product Definition is the easiest way to tie together all the above information. Let’s say we want to deploy a service which:

* Accepts requests on port 8080 with base path `/foo`.
* Accepts external traffic.
* Runs 3 replicas.
* Talks to a neighboring service `bar` using mutual TLS, with bar checking a bcrypt hash of foo’s client secret to authenticate requests.
* Reads and writes data to disk when serving requests.
* Reads its configuration from just one YAML file named `config.yml`.

Our product’s manifest would include a couple extensions in this case:

```yaml
# manifest.yml
extensions:
  public-proxy-endpoints:
    - foo-service-endpoint
  volumes-v2:
    foo-service-data:
      volume-type:
        durable-volume: {}
```

Our `configuration.yml` would look like:

```yaml
# configuration.yml
replication:
  desired: 3

endpoints:
  definitions:
    foo-service-endpoint:
      desired-port: 8080
      path: /foo

volumes:
  foo-service-data:
    desired-size: 10G

generated_secrets:
  bar-client-shared-secret:
    secret-type: random_string
    length: 32

discovery:
  produces:
    bar-client:
      role: bar-client
      client-bcrypted-shared-secret: '{{"bar-client-shared-secret", part: "bcrypt_hash"}}'
  consumes:
    bar-api-uris:
      # discovery role under which bar produces its uris
      role: bar-api
      select: uris

conf:
  config:
    security:
      key-file: '{{ssl.pem_path}}'
      cert-file: '{{ssl.cert_path}}'
      ca-file: '{{ssl.ca_path}}'
    server:
      security: '{{conf.config.security}}'
      port: '{{endpoints.definitions.foo-service-endpoint.desired-port}}'
      base-path: '{{endpoints.definitions.foo-service-endpoint.path}}'
    bar-client:
      security: '{{conf.config.security}}'
      uris: '{{discovered.bar-api-uris}}'
      auth-secret: '{{secret("bar-client-shared-secret")}}'
```
