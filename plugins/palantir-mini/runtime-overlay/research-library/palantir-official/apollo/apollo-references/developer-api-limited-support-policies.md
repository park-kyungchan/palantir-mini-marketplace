# Developer API Limited Support Policies (v1.0)

This page outlines the lifecycle statuses and support policies for features in Apollo.

When a “Limited Support Policy” applies to a feature, this will be clearly marked in the feature's documentation. This will include a reference back to the policies for each category. All changes in support category will be [announced](/docs/apollo/core/whats-new/). The time of that announcement may be referenced in the policies below. When possible, we will group relevant commands or APIs according to their support category at the highest-level of grouping so that you know exactly what you are getting.

These policies may change at any time, but the policies themselves are versioned and are subject to the same stated policy you are reading now! We will communicate any breaking changes via [Announcements](/docs/apollo/core/whats-new/) at least six months in advance of any changes to our Standard and Limited Support Policies.

## Standard Support Policy (Implicit)

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
This is the default policy applied to Apollo features unless otherwise indicated by some Limited Support Marking.
:::

The Apollo Platform Developer APIs describe many features which we want you to use to get more value out of Apollo!

If not otherwise stated within the Developer APIs, these features are implicitly part of our Standard Support Policy, and they can be relied on for your third-party development. We commit to maintaining a high quality set of commands, APIs, and components for you to build on top of, and we will provide appropriate support responses when there are problems. These features may still change, but they will do so in a non-breaking way – adding functionality or making fixes as appropriate to deliver a better platform over time.

It is important to note that we do intend to evolve our platform quickly over the next several years. Features with our Standard Support Policy applied to them may be marked as “Limited Support: Deprecated“ at any time. They are subject to the policy as stated for that support category there forward.

## Limited Support Policies

### Deprecated

We may need to remove specific features of the platform to build a better platform over time.

These features are marked as “Deprecated”, and the feature will be deleted no sooner than six months from the time that the feature deprecation is announced. We expect to actively delete deprecated features after the six month timeline to best support the evolution of the Apollo platform. We will publish an [Announcement](/docs/apollo/core/whats-new/) indicating that it has been Deleted at that time.

We will still provide support for these APIs until the point they are deleted from our API surface area and all relevant documentation. There should be no expectation that any downloaded or cached instance of our CLI, or any scripts which make requests to APIs which have been deleted should continue working after the six month deprecation period. Even if they do so for some period of time, you should have no expectation that you can rely on them.

### Experimental

We may introduce new features over time which are marked as Experimental.

These features may change at any time. Users should anticipate breaks, and only use these where that is acceptable. This may include deleting the experimental command or API altogether, with no replacement made available. We provide more limited support for problems with Experimental commands or APIs.

Commands may exist in an “Experimental” state for a long period of time, and that is not an indication of their relative stability or likelihood to transition to a Standard Support Policy. These are often exciting, but we recommend that you use these commands at your own discretion.
