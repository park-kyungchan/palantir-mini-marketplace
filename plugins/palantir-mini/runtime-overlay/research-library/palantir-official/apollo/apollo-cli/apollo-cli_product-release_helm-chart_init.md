### Flags

| Flag                      | Use                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `--as-tgz` | If set, the output will be an Apollo product TGZ with the extension ".config.tgz" in the specified output directory. |
| `--ca-file` | Helm pull: verify certificates of HTTPS-enabled servers using this CA bundle |
| `--cert-file` | Helm pull: identify HTTPS client using this SSL certificate file |
| `--chart-path` | Path to either a local packaged chart or an unpacked chart directory |
| `-h`, `--help` | Help for init |
| `--image-pre-pull-config-timeout` | Sets the timeout for pre-pulling images (ex: '3m'). Minumum: 1m, Maximum: 90m |
| `--key-file` | Helm pull: identify HTTPS client using this SSL key file |
| `--maven-coordinate` | Maven coordinate for the artifact |
| `--name` | Helm chart name. If the chart resides in a remote OCI repository, this must be the full OCI URL (e.g. oci://repo/chartName) |
| `--output-dir` | Directory where artifacts are written |
| `--pass-credentials` | Helm pull: pass credentials to all domains |
| `--password` | Helm pull: chart repository password where to locate the requested chart |
| `--repository-url` | Helm repository URL where the requested chart can be located |
| `--resource-readiness-timeout` | Sets the length of time the Apollo agent will wait for all resources to become ready after applying changes to Kubernetes (e.g., '5m', '1h', '90m'). This does not affect the Helm timeout for applying changes and running hooks, only the wait for resources to become ready post-apply. Minimum: 3m, Maximum: 4h. Cannot be used with rollout-strategy 'applyChangesNoWait' |
| `--rollout-strategy` | Rollout strategy manifest extension: valid values are 'manageRollout' (default) and 'applyChangesNoWait' |
| `--username` | Helm pull: chart repository username where to locate the requested chart |

| `--version` | Helm chart version |

### Flags inherited from parent commands

| Flag                      | Use                      |

| `--apollo-token-provider` | Specifies how the Bearer Token used for authenticated Apollo endpoint calls is provided. Valid values are "auto", "static", or "service-user" (default "auto"). If "auto" is specified, will use either the Bearer Token provided by "apollo-token" or a Bearer Token obtained by using "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" to generate a token from Multipass depending on which values are set (but will error if both values are set). If "static" is specified, the token provided by "apollo-token" is used. If "service-user" is specified, "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" are used to generate a token from Multipass. |
