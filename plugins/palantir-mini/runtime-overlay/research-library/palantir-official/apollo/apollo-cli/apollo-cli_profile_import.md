# apollo-cli profile import \[Experimental]

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
This command is [Experimental](/docs/apollo/apollo-references/developer-api-limited-support-policies/). To [enable this command](/docs/apollo/apollo-getting-started/apollo-cli-getting-started/#configure-experimental-and-deprecated-commands), run the `apollo-cli configure` command and enable `V2 experimental commands`.

Import a profile from a file

Imports a profile configuration from a file.

The file should be in YAML or JSON format, as exported by 'apollo profile export'.
By default, uses the profile name from the file. Use --name to override.

```bash
apollo-cli profile import <file> [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag                      | Use                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `-h`, `--help` | Help for import |
| `--name` | Override the profile name from the file |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite if profile already exists |
| `--set-current` | Set as the active profile after import |

### Flags inherited from parent commands

| Flag                      | Use                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `--apollo-client-id` | Client ID to use for generating Bearer Token |
| `--apollo-client-secret` | Client secret to use for generating Bearer Token |
| `--apollo-token` | Bearer Token to use for authenticated endpoints |
| `--apollo-token-provider` | Specifies how the Bearer Token used for authenticated Apollo endpoint calls is provided. Valid values are "auto", "static", or "service-user" (default "auto"). If "auto" is specified, will use either the Bearer Token provided by "apollo-token" or a Bearer Token obtained by using "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" to generate a token from Multipass depending on which values are set (but will error if both values are set). If "static" is specified, the token provided by "apollo-token" is used. If "service-user" is specified, "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" are used to generate a token from Multipass. |
| `--apollo-url` | Base URL for Apollo that is used to derive the API endpoints |
| `--debug` | Enable debug level logging |
| `-e`, `--environment` | Environment ID (including suffix) to use for environment-scoped commands |

| `-k`, `--insecure-skip-verify` | Skip verification of server certificate |
| `-o`, `--output` | Output format (json,yaml,pretty) |
| `--profile` | Use a specific profile from your configuration file |
| `--quiet` | Do not print log output to stderr |
| `--space-id` | Space ID to use for certain space-scoped commands |
