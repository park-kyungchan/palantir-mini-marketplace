# apollo-cli environment config get

Gets the configuration for a single environment from the Central Config Service (CCS).
The command writes the environment configuration files and directories to the specified output directory.
This consists of a "metadata.yml" file and directories that contain configuration for services, daemons, and other
Apollo entities.

Combine with environment config apply to modify the output directory and open a change request with your local changes:

1. apollo-cli environment config get <environment> --output-dir configs
2. Modify the configuration in the configs directory
3. apollo-cli environment config apply <environment> --config-dir configs opens a CR with the changes.

```bash
apollo-cli environment config get [environment-id] [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag                      | Use                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `-h`, `--help` | Help for get |
| `--output-dir` | (required) directory in which environment configuration is written. |

### Flags inherited from parent commands

| Flag                      | Use                      |

| `--apollo-token-provider` | Specifies how the Bearer Token used for authenticated Apollo endpoint calls is provided. Valid values are "auto", "static", or "service-user" (default "auto"). If "auto" is specified, will use either the Bearer Token provided by "apollo-token" or a Bearer Token obtained by using "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" to generate a token from Multipass depending on which values are set (but will error if both values are set). If "static" is specified, the token provided by "apollo-token" is used. If "service-user" is specified, "apollo-client-id" and "apollo-client-secret" are used to generate a token from Multipass. |
| `--apollo-url` | Base URL for Apollo that is used to derive the API endpoints |
| `--debug` | Enable debug level logging |
