# Analytics

Foundry provides analytical capabilities for every type of user in an organization, integrated with the Foundry Ontology. Out of the box, Foundry contains both point-and-click and code-based tools that enable table-based analysis, top-down visual analysis, geospatial analysis, temporal analysis, and more. Analytics in Foundry are designed to go beyond conventional “read-only” paradigms to write data back into the Ontology, producing valuable new insights within unified security, lineage, and governance models.

## Core applications

Foundry’s core Analytics applications include:

* [**Contour**](/docs/foundry/contour/overview/), a top-down analysis application for rapidly exploring tabular data at scale, deriving new datasets through visual transformations, and creating charts.
* [**Quiver**](/docs/foundry/quiver/overview/), a multimodal charting application that allows for object-driven analysis, time series-driven analysis, point-and-click machine learning, and dashboard building.
* [**Code Workbook**](/docs/foundry/code-workbook/overview/), an application that blends data engineering and data science motifs, allowing for Python-, R-, or SQL-driven transformations to be rapidly constructed, building and training machine learning models, and much more.
* [**Notepad**](/docs/foundry/notepad/overview/), an integrated solution for embedding dynamic analytical, visual, and operational artifacts from across Foundry, alongside formatted text and media.
* [**Fusion**](/docs/foundry/fusion/overview/), a spreadsheet-driven application that synthesizes tabular computation with the power of Foundry’s Ontology and object-driven query system.

## Analytical connectivity

Foundry is also designed to integrate deeply with your existing analytical tools. Organizations can connect their business intelligence, visualization, and other analytics applications to Foundry through standard APIs and interfaces. Integration options include:

* Out-of-the-box connectors for common tools, like **[Power BI®](/docs/foundry/analytics-connectivity/power-bi-overview/)** and **[Tableau](/docs/foundry/analytics-connectivity/tableau-overview/)**.
* **[REST APIs](/docs/foundry/api/general/overview/introduction/)** for ad-hoc connectivity.
* **[ODBC and JDBC drivers](/docs/foundry/analytics-connectivity/odbc-jdbc-drivers/)** for general connectivity.
* **[Python ↗](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-python-sdk)** and **[R ↗](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-r-sdk)** SDKs for connection to data science tools.
* Guided integrations for tools like Microsoft Report Builder and Excel, which leverage standard interfaces.
