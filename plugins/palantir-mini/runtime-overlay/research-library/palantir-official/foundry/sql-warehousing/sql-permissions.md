# SQL permissions

This page describes the [roles](/docs/foundry/platform-security-management/manage-roles/) that govern access to SQL functionality in Foundry, including [SQL Studio](/docs/foundry/sql-warehousing/sql-studio/), the embedded [SQL console](/docs/foundry/sql-warehousing/sql-console/), and external SQL clients connected via [Arrow Flight SQL](/docs/foundry/sql-warehousing/arrow-flight-sql/) or the SQL [REST API](/docs/foundry/api/v2/sql-queries-v2-resources/sql-queries/execute-sql-query/).

Roles described here are part of the **Foundry SQL Server** and **Download** role set categories.

## Relevant operations

The following operations control SQL access. A user must hold at least one of `foundry-sql-server:preview` or `foundry-sql-server:read` on a resource to run any SQL against it.

| Operation | Foundry behavior | External API behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Preview: `foundry-sql-server:preview` | Results preview returns the first 1,000 rows of the query result. | - |
| Query: `foundry-sql-server:read` | Results preview defaults to 1,000 rows. In SQL Studio, users can extend the preview limit to 10,000 rows from the settings menu. | Returns the complete query result with no row limit. |
| Download: `foundry-sql-server:frontend-download` | Required for the **Download** action in the results panel. Downloads the rows displayed in the results preview (up to 1,000 rows). | — |
| Worksheet read: `foundry-sql-server:read-worksheet` | Open and view saved SQL worksheets. | — |
| Worksheet write: `foundry-sql-server:write-worksheet` | Create, edit, and save SQL worksheets. | — |

These operations can be granted as part of the default role sets or via a custom role within a [custom role set](/docs/foundry/platform-security-management/manage-roles/#role-sets).

Querying the ontology via [ontology SQL](/docs/foundry/sql-warehousing/ontology-sql/) does not require an additional role. Access follows the standard ontology roles on the object types being queried.

## Custom role configurations

Default roles can be customized through [custom role sets](/docs/foundry/platform-security-management/manage-roles/#role-sets). Common configurations include:

* **Restricting Query:** Some organizations restrict `Query datasets using SQL` to prevent users from running unbounded queries via the SQL API. In this case, `Preview datasets using SQL` can still be granted to allow users to run capped queries inside Foundry.
* **Separating Download from Query:** Some organizations restrict `Download SQL results in Foundry` to prevent users from downloading results via the UI download button, even if they are granted preview permissions.

## AI-assisted query generation

The [AI-assisted query generation](/docs/foundry/sql-warehousing/sql-studio/#ai-assisted-query-generation) feature is gated on AIP enablement rather than a roleset permission.

AIP must be enabled for the user's organization and for the project containing the queried resource. For details, see [AIP permissions](/docs/foundry/aip/enable-aip-features/#aip-permissions).
