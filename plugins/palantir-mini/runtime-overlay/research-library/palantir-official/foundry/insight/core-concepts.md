# Core concepts

Insight uses the following terms and tools throughout its interface. Familiarize yourself with these concepts before creating analyses with Ontology resources.

## Workbook

When data analysis is saved, a workbook is the resulting Insight resource that contains the data, states, and results of your analysis. Workbooks are the primary file type for Insight that you will find in [Compass](/docs/foundry/compass/overview/).

## Path

A path is an analysis tab within a workbook. Paths can be duplicated and referenced within a workbook and shared with other workbooks.

## Object set

An object set is a published version of the filters defined in a workbook path. While a path is local to the workbook, the object set is a platform resource that can be viewed and used in other applications. If object sets are modified or deleted, users with access to those object sets may be affected.

## Static list

You can create a static list by selecting individual objects and adding them to a new or existing list. You can also save object sets and paths as a static list to preserve a point-in-time snapshot of the data.

## Object set reference

An object set reference is a path that starts with an object set. The referenced object set is read-only and defines the path's starting data. You can view its filters and other configuration within the path, but you cannot modify them.

## Object set copy

An object set copy duplicates an object set's definition, including its filters and any other configuration. Changes to the original object set do not affect paths that use the copy.
