# Global Branching

**Global Branching** (previously known as "Foundry Branching") enables you to develop and test comprehensive end-to-end workflows in the Palantir platform that might otherwise be too disruptive or risky for a live production environment.

While [code repositories](/docs/foundry/code-repositories/branch-settings/), [data pipelines](/docs/foundry/data-integration/branching/) and the [Ontology](/docs/foundry/ontologies/ontology-branches-legacy/) support separate branching workflows, Global Branching provides a unified experience to make modifications across multiple applications on a single branch, test those changes end-to-end without disrupting the production environment, and merge those changes with a single click.

Global Branching is in active development; see the list of [supported functionality](/docs/foundry/global-branching/supported-functionality/) for more information on available features.

## Enable Global Branching

Administrators can enable Global Branching within the Application Access section in Control Panel. Global Branching is available for Pipeline Builder, the Ontology, Workshop, datasets in Code Repositories, and running actions on a branch.

Note that if your Workshop module contains non-Workshop elements for which Global Branching is not available, such as Quiver dashboards, these elements will not be modifiable on a branch.

## Example Global Branching workflow

You can make changes to transforms code repositories, Pipeline Builder, the Ontology, and Workshop modules on a single branch. You can also run Actions on branches without writing back edits to `Main`.

For instance, take a workflow that consists of a simple pipeline in Pipeline Builder that outputs a dataset used to back an object type. With Global Branching, you can make changes to the logic and schema of your output dataset on a branch, see these changes in Ontology Manager on that same branch, and modify the object type definition as a result.

Global Branching also supports a review process; developers can add reviewers for different resources depending on each resource's approval policy. Once changes are finalized and approved, they can be deployed into the `Main` branch. This feature ensures a safe and controlled approach to updating and improving data pipelines, the Ontology, and Workshop applications.

## Branch cost and retention

Each branch has associated compute and storage costs, and modifying large object types on a branch can incur significant additional costs. Branch cost insights in [Resource Management](/docs/foundry/resource-management/overview/) are currently in progress. Branches are intended to be relatively short-lived, and retention policies are available to automatically close stagnant branches.

## Global Branching vs. release management

Global Branching enables development and testing of workflow changes on a separate branch. This is ideal for managing changes in a development environment, as it allows developers to work in isolation and only merge changes into the `Main` branch when the feature is complete. [Release management](/docs/foundry/devops-release-management/overview/) is the process of managing multiple versions of resources across distinct environments that serve different purposes.

[Release management](/docs/foundry/devops-release-management/overview/) and Global Branching can work together harmoniously. They should not be seen as alternative solutions to the same problem, but rather complementary solutions to different problems.

For example, you can use release management and Global Branching together when developing a large feature that needs to be added to a workflow. Larger features could take a few weeks to develop and require foundational changes to dataset and object type schemas. You can develop this feature on a Global branch and merge the changes into the development environment when it is completed. Then, you can use release management to deploy these changes to your test and production environments.
