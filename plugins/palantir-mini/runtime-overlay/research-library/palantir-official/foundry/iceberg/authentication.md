# Authenticating Iceberg clients

This section describes how Iceberg clients can authenticate with Foundry's Iceberg catalog. These
steps are not required when using Iceberg within Foundry.

Foundry's Iceberg catalog implements the [specification ↗](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/071d5606bc6199a0be9b3f274ec7fbf111d88821/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L4870-L4891)
for Iceberg REST catalogs. This means that Iceberg clients that support REST catalogs can use the
authentication mechanisms defined in the spec when interacting with Foundry's Iceberg catalog.

When configuring Iceberg clients, the following authentication options are available:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `OAuth2 client credentials` | Authenticate as a service user using a client ID and client secret. Once configured, the Iceberg client will perform any necessary token exchange. |
| `Bearer` | Authenticate as a user using an API token (generally referred to as a bearer token). |

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
Clients should not be configured with credentials to cloud storage (such as S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)). See the [Access delegation & credential vending](#access-delegation--credential-vending) section below for details on how to grant access to clients via the catalog.
:::

## Using an API token

API tokens, also called Bearer Tokens, are the fastest way to authenticate and get started. You can generate an API token for your user by following the [User-generated tokens](/docs/foundry/platform-security-third-party/user-generated-tokens/) documentation.

The following properties are required when configuring an Iceberg client with a bearer token:

| Key | Example | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | `https://<hostname>/iceberg` | Yes | URI identifying the Foundry Iceberg catalog |
| `token` | `eyJwb...` | Yes | Bearer token value to use for Authorization header |

The example below uses the Python Iceberg client (PyIceberg) and configures a catalog in a
[`~/.pyiceberg.yaml` ↗](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/configuration/#setting-configuration-values).
The catalog properties are documented [here ↗](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/configuration/#rest-catalog)
and can be adapted for other Iceberg client implementations that support REST catalogs.

```
catalog:
  foundry:
    uri: https://your.foundry/iceberg
    token: eyJwb...
```

:::callout{theme="warning"}
These generated bearer tokens are long-lived and tied to your user. They should be handled with
care. We recommend using OAuth2 for production usage and limiting token-based authentication to
development.
:::

## Using OAuth2

You can use OAuth2 with Iceberg clients for increased security over directly providing an API
bearer token. You will need to create a third-party OAuth2 application with the client credentials
grant as documented [here](/docs/foundry/platform-security-third-party/writing-oauth2-clients/#client-credentials-grant).

The Iceberg client is given the generated client credentials and a URL to the authorization server
which exchanges client credentials for an application token. Iceberg clients handle this exchange
and subsequent token refresh.

The following properties are used when configuring an Iceberg client for OAuth2:

| Key | Example | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uri` | `https://<hostname>/iceberg` | Yes | URI identifying the Foundry Iceberg catalog |
| `oauth2-server-uri` | `https://<hostname>/iceberg/v1/oauth/tokens` | Yes | URI identifying the authorization server |
| `credential` | `client_id:client_secret` | Yes | Credential to use for OAuth2 credential flow when initializing the catalog |
| `scope` | `api:iceberg-read api:iceberg-write` | No | Space-separated scope to limit permissions |

With these properties, you can configure a PyIceberg catalog client for OAuth2 as shown below:

```yaml
catalog:
  default:
    uri: https://your.foundry/iceberg
    oauth2-server-uri: https://your.foundry/iceberg/v1/oauth/tokens  # OAuth2 server URL
    credential: 17f...:037...  # client_id:client_secret
    scope: api:iceberg-read api:iceberg-write  # optional, space-separated scope
```

The `scope` configuration is optional. Permissions default to the permissions of the service user
created for the third-party application. You can limit scope to only allow reads by declaring
`api:iceberg-read` without `api:iceberg-write`.

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Foundry uses an Iceberg-flavored authorization server and thus a different endpoint than
[the endpoint](/docs/foundry/platform-security-third-party/writing-oauth2-clients/#authorization-endpoint)
generally used for OAuth2 clients.
:::

## Access delegation & credential vending

Storage access is delegated by the Iceberg catalog using the access delegation mechanisms described in the
[Iceberg specification ↗](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/fa80ba787af776f516e772f27bf746756de93b70/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L1853-L1877). Foundry's catalog offers credential vending (recommended) or remote signing according to the following support matrix:

|Storage location   |Credential vending |Credential refresh |Remote signing     |
|---                |---                |---                |---                |
|ABFS               |Yes, via SAS tokens   |No                  |No                  |
|S3                 |Yes, via STS tokens   |Yes                  |Yes                  |

### Credential vending

:::callout{theme="success"}
With credential vending, Foundry's Iceberg catalog grants data access to authenticated clients through scoped, short-lived vended credentials. This approach enforces the principle of least privilege and enhances security by minimizing exposure of storage credentials.
:::

When an Iceberg client interacts with Foundry's Iceberg catalog, storage credentials are never provided directly by the user or application. Instead, the Foundry Iceberg catalog issues temporary credentials that are tightly scoped to specific data and permissions.

The credential vending process works as follows:

* **Access request:** The Iceberg client initiates a request to access one or more tables using the Foundry Iceberg REST catalog API; for example, when loading table metadata.
* **Authentication:** Foundry's REST catalog authenticates the client and verifies their permissions for the requested table and action.
* **Credential vending:** If the client is authorized, Foundry's catalog "vends" (that is, issues) short-lived, narrowly scoped storage credentials. Each vended credential is valid only for specific files and for a limited duration.
* **Data access:** The client uses these temporary credentials to directly access the underlying storage (such as S3 or ABFS) to read or write data. Once the credentials expire, access is automatically revoked.

## Troubleshooting authentication

If you encounter issues connecting to the Foundry Iceberg REST catalog, use the steps below to isolate the problem.

### Verify connectivity with a bearer token

Start by confirming that you can connect to the catalog using an API token from a [local Jupyter notebook](/docs/foundry/iceberg/local-jupyter/). This verifies basic network connectivity and catalog access independently of your OAuth2 configuration.

```python
from pyiceberg.catalog import load_rest
from getpass import getpass

token = getpass("Foundry user token:")

catalog = load_rest(
    "foundry",
    {
        "uri": "https://<your_foundry_url>/iceberg",
        "token": token,
    },
)

table = catalog.load_table("<table_rid>")
print(table.snapshots())
del token
```

Replace `<your_foundry_url>` with your Foundry hostname and `<table_rid>` with your Iceberg table's resource identifier. If this step succeeds, the catalog is reachable and your user has the correct permissions.

### Verify OAuth2 credentials

After confirming bearer token connectivity, test your OAuth2 client credentials from a [local Jupyter notebook](/docs/foundry/iceberg/local-jupyter/). This verifies that the third-party application, its scopes, and the service user permissions are configured correctly. If this step is not successful, verify that the third-party application and its scopes are configured correctly and that the service account has been granted permissions to access the relevant Compass folders and Iceberg tables.

```python
from pyiceberg.catalog import load_rest
from getpass import getpass

foundry_url = "https://<your_foundry_url>"
client_id = "<your_client_id>"

client_secret = getpass("OAuth2 client secret:")

catalog = load_rest(
    name="foundry",
    conf={
        "uri": f"{foundry_url}/iceberg",
        "oauth2-server-uri": f"{foundry_url}/iceberg/v1/oauth/tokens",
        "credential": f"{client_id}:{client_secret}",
        "scope": "api:iceberg-read api:iceberg-write",
    },
)

# List namespaces to verify catalog access
print(catalog.list_namespaces())

# Load a specific table to verify table-level permissions.
# If you are unable to read the table, verify that the service account associated with the third-party application has permissions to access it.
table = catalog.load_table("<table_rid>")
print(table.snapshots())
del client_secret
```

Replace `<your_foundry_url>`, `<your_client_id>`, and `<table_rid>` with your environment-specific values.
