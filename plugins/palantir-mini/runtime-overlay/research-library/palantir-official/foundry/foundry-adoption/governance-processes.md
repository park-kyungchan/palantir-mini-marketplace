# Governance processes

As you build and grow your Foundry Program team, we recommend implementing governance processes to manage and guide your organization's efforts. To assist you in creating governance processes, this page provides examples of strategic planning and governance checkpoints that can be adapted for your own use. These planning, review, and development stages can help prepare your team for the various responsibilties and activities involved in successful maintenance, use, and deployment of the Foundry platform within your organization.

Note that the processes described on this page are suggestions and not requirements. We provide these as an example of one way in which you can structure governance processes, but your organization's needs will likely require customization of the processes described here.

## Foundry Program planning

### SteerCo meetings: Vision setting

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Quarterly
* **Owner:** Head of Program
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Program Manager, Executives/Senior Stakeholders, Domain Leads

Steering committee (SteerCo) meetings are regular meetings that are central to the high-level direction of the Foundry Program. The primary purpose of a SteerCo meeting should be to evaluate the strategic direction, scope, and cost of the Foundry platform as a whole. It is common for specific high-priority projects to be discussed during a SteerCo, but they should not be the sole focus of the meeting.

A sample agenda for a SteerCo meeting might include:

* Review of live, in-development, and prospective use cases, along with the associated costs, development progress, and value to the organization.
* Overview of changes to the user base (for example, the growth/decline in number of users or usage by group/use case).
* Review/discuss the Foundry platform within the context of the organization's broader IT landscape and goals.

### Development and roadmap review

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Monthly
* **Owner:** Program Manager
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Head of Program, Domain Leads

Development and roadmap reviews are meant to review the past month's progress and align on deliverables for the coming month and longer-term roadmap. This session is a forum for reviewing the progress of ongoing development initiatives, discussing opportunities for enhancements to existing use cases, and identifying and prioritizing opportunities for new use cases.

A sample agenda for each session might include:

* Progress updates for ongoing development.
* Assessment of business cases to determine and confirm use case value.
* Assess and approve changes to project plans.
* Making decisions based on the priority of deliverables/development.
* Review and approve use case development strategy.
* Review and suggest solutions for the issues critical to project success.

## Active use case development

### Standup

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Daily
* **Owner:** Data Lead(s)
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Ontology Lead(s), Use Case Lead, Data Governance Administrator (as needed)

Standup is a short (<30 min) daily call during which each member of a use case team provides a progress update.

Standup updates are typically limited to:

* What was worked on during the previous day.
* What will be worked on during the current day.
* Review of any blockers preventing progress.

### Sprint planning

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Bi-weekly
* **Owner:** Data Lead(s)
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Ontology Lead(s), Use Case Lead, Data Governance Administrator (as needed)

During sprint planning meetings, attendees review what was and was not completed from the previous sprint and decide what will be worked on in the upcoming sprint.

An example agenda includes:

* Review of team deliverables/objectives.
* Discussion of current blockers and changes in development priority.
* Confirmation of team capacity for the upcoming sprint.
* Confirm deliverable requirements and make any appropriate updates.
* Assign size estimates, determine the sprint's contents, and assign work.

## Platform governance

### Project creation review

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Monthly
* **Owner:** Head of Program (Phase 1), Head of Data Governance (Phase 2+)
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Program Manager

New projects are suggested by users across the organization by submitting a creation request through a Project Creation Request Portal built by the program team. Those requests are then reviewed and either approved or denied from a Project Approval Inbox application, also built by the program team.

If a request is approved, the requested project is created, controlling for role assignment and group access in accordance to the details of the request. Project creation permissions for each Foundry space should be restricted to the central Platform Governance team; the roles that fill this team will evolve over time as platform governance grows more specific throughout the phases of development.

### Project access review

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Ongoing
* **Owner:** Head of Program (Phase 1), Head of Data Governance (Phase 2+)
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Program Manager

Project roles should be controlled such that only designated groups hold specific roles on projects. We recommend ensuring that groups are tied directly to the organization's identity provider (IdP) groups.

Access requests are reviewed and either approved or denied the request from the Project Approval Inbox.
Upon request approval, the requestor's account is added to the group(s) with the appropriate role on the Project.

Depending on where groups are managed, this will require either adding the requestor's network account to the IdP group, or adding their Foundry account to the Foundry-specific group. We recommend that individual users are **not** granted roles directly on a Project.

### Data permission administration review

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Ongoing
* **Owner:** Head of Program (Phase 1), Head of Data Governance (Phase 2+)
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Use Case Lead

Data permission administration in Foundry takes several forms, from controlling blanket access to datasets or entire pipelines, to controlling visibility of records within a dataset.

Data permission administration requirements for a particular use case should be scoped out as a part of the Project Creation Review process. Documenting and applying the appropriate data permissions takes place during Project development.

## User enablement

### Support team development

* **Phase:** 1+
* **Frequency:** Ongoing
* **Owner:** Data Lead, Program Manager
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Domain Leads, Data Governance Administrator, Use Case Lead

We recommend the creation of an internal support structure to assist with user issue triage, investigation, and resolution. This structure can be significantly impactful in retaining autonomy within your organization and in ensuring any issues that require Palantir involvement will have the required level of detail provided before escalation.

* **Phase 1/2:** Support may be handled by the Foundry Program team
* **Phase 2+:** We recommend establishing a dedicated internal Foundry Support team

### Training development

* **Phase:** 2+
* **Frequency:** Ongoing
* **Owner:** Education & Training Expert
* **Attendees/Stakeholders:** Domain Lead(s), Use Case Lead

Palantir offers centralized training resources, but we recommend that Foundry Program teams also develop an internal training curriculum specific to each of the organization's use cases.

This includes developing and maintaining the documentation for each use case's data lineage and ontology components, as well as tutorials for how users should engage with core applications. Training mediums can include in-platform and external documentation (for example, interface tutorials and documentation), as well as recorded and in-person training/tutorials.
