# Legacy REST API Plugin (magritte-rest-v2)

:::callout{theme="danger"}
The legacy REST API options documented here using the custom `magritte-rest-v2` source type are for historical reference only. This feature is no longer under active development and should not be used.

Use instead the [REST API source type](/docs/foundry/available-connectors/rest-apis/) that supports:

* [Webhooks](/docs/foundry/data-connection/webhooks-overview/)
* Syncs and exports via [external transforms](/docs/foundry/data-connection/external-transforms/)

The REST API source type can also be used to connect to on-premise REST APIs using [agent proxy egress policies](/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/#agent-proxy-egress-policies).
:::

## Architecture

The following concepts illustrate the flow of information when using a `magritte-rest-v2` source.

* The **source** defines how a connection is established. This includes how the request should authenticate.
* The **sync** consists of a list of **calls**. Each call defines what sort of request should be made and implements any required logic around this request. A call can be as simple as a single GET request or more complex such as a loop of requests for pagination.
* An **extractor** defines how to parse the response to both authentication calls and sync calls. For sync calls, it can save fields in the response to a **state**.
* The resulting **state** is passed on to the next call. The variables in this `state` can then be injected into the proceeding calls. This allows for interdependent requests.

This diagram illustrates how the above concepts interact:

## Create a custom `magritte-rest-v2` source

To create a `magritte-rest-v2` source, select **New source** from the **Sources** tab of the Data Connection application. Then, select the option to **Add Custom Source**. The magritte-rest-v2 plugin is primarily configured via a YAML editor.

The following examples provide YAML code snippets necessary for configuration of different authentication types:

* [Headers](#headers)
* [Username and password](#username-and-password)
* [Body](#body)
* [URL parameters](#url-parameters)
* [Call](#call)
* [Call to another domain](#call-to-another-domain)
* [Client certificate](#client-certificate)
* [NTLM](#ntlm)

This documentation also provides additional guidance on these topics:

* [Proxy](#proxy)
* [Server certificate issues](#server-certificate-issues)
* [TLS version](#tls-version)

### Authentication

#### Headers

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer {{token}}'
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
```

#### Username and password

Also known as `Basic` authentication.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    usernamePassword: '{{username}}:{{password}}'
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
```

#### Body

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    requestMimeType: application/json
    body: '{"username": "{{username}}", "password": "{{password}}"}'
    authCalls: []
```

#### URL parameters

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    parameters:
      username: "{{username}}"
      password: "{{password}}"
    authCalls: []
```

#### Call

The following configuration can be used to submit a URL-encoded form body to an `/auth` endpoint in order to use the returned token in a sync. You should only use `formBody` if your endpoint has a form type; otherwise use `body`.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer {%token%}'
    authCalls:
      - type: magritte-rest-call
        path: /auth
        method: POST
        formBody:
          username: '{{username}}'
          password: '{{password}}'
        extractor:
          - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
            assign:
              token: /token
```

If the returned token regularly expires prior to the completion of your syncs, use the `authExpiration` parameter to specify how often the calls under `authCalls` should be retried. Set the value of `authExpiration` to be no longer than the validity period of the token returned by the `/auth` endpoint.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    authExpiration: 30m
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer {%token%}'
    authCalls:
      - type: magritte-rest-call
        path: /auth
        method: POST
        formBody:
          username: '{{username}}'
          password: '{{password}}'
        extractor:
          - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
            assign:
              token: /token
```

When your API uses security headers like subscription keys in order to log in successfully, you will have to add an additional header section underneath `authCalls`. This second header section is used specifically for the authentication call, and is entirely separate from the first header section; all other API calls (aside from the authentication call) use the first header section. Not having these header sections properly configured may result in 401 authentication failures. An example is given below.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    headers:
      X-service-identifier: SWN
      Authorization: 'Bearer {%token%}'
      Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: '{{subscriptionKey}}'
    authCalls:
      - type: magritte-rest-call
        path: /auth
        method: POST
        headers:
          X-service-identifier: SWN
          Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: '{{subscriptionKey}}'
        body:
          username: '{{username}}'
          password: '{{password}}'
        extractor:
          - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
            assign:
              token: /token
```

#### Call to another domain

This enables authentication against one domain in order to use the token on another domain:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  auth_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: "https://auth.api.com"
  data_api:
    type: magritte-rest-auth-call-source
    url: "https://data-api.com/"
    headers:
      Authorization: 'Bearer {%token%}'
    authCalls:
      - type: magritte-rest-call
        source: auth_api
        path: /auth
        method: POST
        formBody:
          username: '{{username}}'
          password: '{{password}}'
        extractor:
          - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
            assign:
              token: /token
```

#### Client certificate

Sources support supplying a Java KeyStore (JKS) file for authentication:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: "https://some-api.com/"
    keystorePath: "/my/keystore/keystore.jks"
    keystorePassword: "{{password}}"
```

#### NTLM

The following curl: `curl -v http://example.com/do.asmx --ntlm -u DOMAIN\\username:password` can be translated as:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-ntlm-source
url: http://example.com
user: "{{username}}"
password: "{{password}}"
domain: DOMAIN (optional)
workstation: (optional) the name of your machine as given by $(hostname)
```

### Proxy

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: http://example.com
    proxy: 'http://my-proxy:8888/' # you can also pass an IP Address
```

You can also pass in proxy credentials in the config:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: http://example.com
    proxy:
      url: 'http://my-proxy:8888/' # you can also pass an IP Address
      username: 'my-proxy-username'
      password: 'my-proxy-password'
```

### Server certificate issues

If you see errors like `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException` you might need to add the server's certificate to agent's trust-store, following [this guide](/docs/foundry/data-connection/agent-configuration-reference/#certificates).

For debugging purposes only, you might also disable checking of the certificate, which corresponds to running curl with the insecure `-k` flag (`curl -k https://some-domain`):

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: https://example.com
    insecure: true
```

#### TLS version

By default, the plugin will connect only over modern TLS versions (TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3).

To use an older version, specify the TLS version in the config:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-v2
sourceMap:
  my_api:
    type: magritte-rest
    url: https://example.com
    tlsVersion: 'TLSv1.1'
```

Supported versions: `TLSv1.3`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1`, `SSLv3`.

## Create a sync

To create a sync, from the top of your `magritte-rest-v2` Source click the "Create Sync" button. The Basic view will guide you through creating one or more calls to fetch data. The Advanced view will enable you to edit the YAML configuration directly. You can toggle between these views at the top right of the page.

A sync requires at least one call. In the basic view, you can create new calls by clicking the "Add" button under the "Perform calls in sequence" heading.
You can then specify if the call should be made once by selecting "Single Call" or multiple times based on a loop, a time range, a date range, a list, or by paging over results.
Each call requires a path which will be appended to the source URL when queried. For example, if the source has the url `https://my-ap-source.com` using a path of `/api/v1/get-documents` would result in the call querying `https://my-ap-source.com/api/v1/get-documents`.

This section presents a list of YAML configurations that address common scenarios:

* [DateTime-based API](#datetime-based-api)
* [Page-based API](#page-based-api)
* [Offset-based API](#offset-based-api)
* [Next-Page link-based API](#next-page-link-based-api)
* [Triggering and downloading a report](#triggering-and-downloading-a-report)

This documentation also provides additional guidance on these topics:

* [Incremental Syncs](#incremental-syncs)

### Common Scenarios

#### DateTime-based API

Assume an API that serves CSV reports for each date at `/daily_data?date=2020-01-01`. In this example, we would like to ingest these reports as they become available. To achieve this, we could schedule a daily sync that will remember the last date for which reports were synced, in order to automatically fetch the reports for unsynced dates up to today:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: csv
incrementalStateVars:
  incremental_date_to_query: '2020-01-01'
initialStateVars:
  yesterday:
    type: magritte-rest-datetime-expression
    offset: '-P1D'
    timezone: UTC
    formatString: 'yyyy-MM-dd'
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-increasing-date-param-call
    checkConditionFirst: true
    paramToIncrease: date_to_query
    increaseBy: P1D
    initValue: '{%incremental_date_to_query%}'
    stopValue: '{%yesterday%}'
    format: 'yyyy-MM-dd'
    method: GET
    path: '/daily_data'
    parameters:
      date: '{%date_to_query%}'
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
        fromStateVar: 'date_to_query'
        var: 'incremental_date_to_query'
```

You may find it helpful to compare the above configuration with an equivalent Python snippet.

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

incremental_state = load_incremental_state()
if incremental_state is None:
  incremental_state = {'incremental_date_to_query': '2020-01-01'}

yesterday = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=1)

date_to_query = incremental_state['incremental_date_to_query']
date_to_query = datetime.strptime(date_to_query, '%Y-%m-%d')
while yesterday >= date_to_query:
  response = requests.get(source.url + '/daily_data', params={
    'date': date_to_query.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
  })
  upload(response)
  date_to_query += timedelta(days=1)
  incremental_date_to_query = date_to_query

save_incremental_state({'incremental_date_to_query': incremental_date_to_query})
```

#### Page-based API

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-paging-inc-param-call
    paramToIncrease: page
    initValue: 0
    increaseBy: 1
    method: GET
    path: '/data'
    parameters:
      page: '{%page%}'
      entries_per_page: 1000
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
        assign:
          page_items: '/items'
    condition:
      type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
      var: page_items
```

If you are a developer, you might find it easier to understand the above configuration by comparing it with an equivalent python snippet:

```python
import requests

page = 0
while True:
  response = requests.get(source.url + '/data', params={
    'page': page,
    'entries_per_page': 1000
  })
  upload(response)

  page += 1
  page_items = response.json().get('items')
  if not page_items:
    break
```

#### Offset-based API

Here is an example ElasticSearch basic search API:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-paging-inc-param-call
    paramToIncrease: offset
    initValue: 0
    increaseBy: 100
    method: POST
    path: '/_search'
    body: |-
      {
        "from": {%offset%},
        "size": 100
      }
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
        assign:
          hits: '/hits'
    condition:
      type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
      var: hits
```

#### Next page link-based API

Next page tokens are also often known as cursor, continuation, or pagination tokens.

Here is an example ElasticSearch search and scrolling API:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    method: GET
    path: /my-es-index/_search?scroll=1m
    parameters:
      scroll: 1m
    extractor:
      - type: json
        assign:
          scroll_id: /_scroll_id
  - type: magritte-do-while-call
    method: GET
    checkConditionFirst: true
    path: /_search/scroll
    parameters:
      scroll: 1m
      scroll_id: '{%scroll_id%}'
    extractor:
      - type: json
        assign:
          scroll_id: /_scroll_id
          hits: /hits
    timeBetweenCalls: 0s
    condition:
      type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
      var: hits
```

Here is an example AWS nextToken paginated API:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    method: POST
    path: /findings/list
    extractor:
      - type: json
        assign:
          nextToken: /nextToken
        allowNull: false
        allowMissingField: true
    requestMimeType: application/json
    body: '{}'
  - type: magritte-do-while-call
    method: POST
    checkConditionFirst: true
    path: /findings/list
    extractor:
      - type: json
        assign:
          findings: /findings
          nextToken: /nextToken
        allowNull: false
        allowMissingField: true
    condition:
      type: magritte-rest-available-condition
      var: nextToken
    timeBetweenCalls: 0s
    requestMimeType: appliation/json
    body: '{"nextToken":"{%nextToken%}"}'
```

#### Triggering and downloading a report

The following `sync` is for an API that requires three interdependent steps.

* A body is posted to an endpoint that returns a response containing an ID.
* This ID needs to be used in the next endpoint to fetch a report. However, the report is not immediately ready, so the response contains a field named `status` defining if the report is done.
* Once the report is done, we can fetch the report from a third endpoint.

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    path: '/findRelevantId'
    method: POST
    requestMimeType: application/json
    extractor:
      - type: json
        assign:
          id: /id
    body: >
      body
    saveResponse: false
  - type: magritte-do-while-call
    path: '/reportReady'
    method: GET
    parameters:
      id: '{%id%}'
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
        assign:
          status: /status
    condition:
      type: "magritte-rest-regex-condition"
      var: status
      matches: "(processing|queued)"
    timeBetweenCalls: 8s
    saveResponse: false
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    path: '/getReport/{%id%}'
    method: GET
    requestMimeType: application/json
```

The Extractor defines what fields to save in the state. Note that these variables are available in all following REST calls. To inject a saved variable, surround the variable name by {%%}. The second `do-while` call implements a loop that sends a request until the status variable is no longer queued or processing.

Some APIs do not have a `status` endpoint and instead require to poll the `getReport` endpoint, providing an empty response until the report is ready. The following config shows how to deal with such scenario:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-do-while-call
    path: '/getReport/{%id%}'
    method: GET
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
        var: response
    condition:
      type: magritte-rest-not-condition
      condition:
         type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
         var: response
    timeBetweenCalls: 8s
```

Or if the `getReport` endpoint would return a `204` status code until the report is ready, it could be handled as:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-do-while-call
    path: '/getReport/{%id%}'
    method: GET
    extractor:
     -  type: magritte-rest-http-status-code-extractor
        assign: responseCode
    condition:
        type: magritte-rest-regex-condition
        var: responseCode
        matches: 204
    timeBetweenCalls: 8s
```

### Incremental syncs

This plugin supports incremental Syncs. To do this, pick the variables from the `state` that you want to save as the Sync's incremental `state` by specifying `incrementalStateVars`:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
incrementalStateVars:
  var_name: initial_value # Initial value used if no incremental metadata is found
```

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
incrementalStateVars:
  lastModifiedDate: 20190101
```

The saved incremental `state` will be used as the initial `state` when running a sync.

More detailed example:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: json
incrementalStateVars:
  lastModifiedTime: 'Some initial start time'
initialStateVars:
# get the current time
  currentTime:
    type: magritte-rest-datetime-expression
    timezone: 'Some timezone, e.g. Europe/Paris'
    formatString: 'Some format string https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ \
                     java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html'
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    path: /my/values
    method: GET
    parameters:
      from: '{%lastModifiedTime%}'
      until: '{%currentTime%}'
    extractor:
    # Update the last modified time to be the current time
      - type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
        var: lastModifiedTime
        fromStateVar: currentTime
```

## Detailed documentation

If you add more than one API source, in each REST call you must specify the source you want to use with the `source` attribute.

### Syncs

The sync config contains the following fields.

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
restCalls: [calls] # see documentation for Calls below
initialStateVars:
  {variableName}: {variableValue}
incrementalStateVars:
  {variableName}: {variableValue}
outputFileType: json # required for oneFilePerResponse
cacheToDisk: defaults to True
oneFilePerResponse: defaults to True; when set to True "outputFileType" is required
```

To set an output file type with `outputFileType`, `oneFilePerResponse` must be true, otherwise the responses will be saved as rows in a dataset. See [Storing response](#storing-response) below for recommended options based on your response type.

#### Storing response

Recommended for binary responses or total sum of response size > 100MB:

```yaml
cacheToDisk: true
outputFileType: [any file format, e.g. txt, json, jpg]
oneFilePerResponse: true # default, don't need to specify
```

For non-binary responses up to couple of MB and a total sum of response size below 100MB, we recommend the following:

```yaml
cacheToDisk: false
oneFilePerResponse: false
```

For a sync where the responses don't fit on disk, but the total sync time is low (under 3 minutes), we recommend the following:

```yaml
cacheToDisk: false
oneFilePerResponse: true
outputFileType: [any file format, e.g. txt, json, jpg]
```

### Calls

#### Core call fields

All calls inherit from a base RestCall object, which contains the following fields:

```yaml
type: Rest call type
path: Endpoint
method: GET | POST | PUT | PATCH
# All below are optional
source: The API source to use for this call. # This is required if there are multiple api sources.
parameters: Map of parameters to pass with request # Defaults to empty map
saveResponse: Should the response be saved in foundry # Defaults to True
body: Body to post
formBody:
    # Map of parameters to use in a x-www-form-urlencoded post.
    # Optional, only use instead of body when hitting a x-www-form-urlencoded endpoint.
    param1: value1
requestMimeType: application/json
headers: Request headers, these append to the source headers, but replace matching headers
# validResponseCodes: optional, set of HTTP response codes for which the API caller does not terminate.
# If not set, valid HTTP response codes are 200, 201 and 204.
validResponseCodes:
   - 200
   - 201
   - 204
# retries: defaults to 0. Requests can fail due to cancellation, a connectivity problem or timeout.
# Enables setting the desired number of retries per request made by this call.
retries: 0
extractor: A list of extractor object, see Extractors
# Filename template e.g. 'data_{%page%}',
# otherwise the filename will be '[sourceName][path][parameters]'
filename: '<dont override if not necessary>'
addTimestampToFilename: Defaults to true, whether timestamp should be appended to filename
```

Inheriting calls can add additional fields to the ones above.

#### REST call

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-call
```

Performs a single request. Uses the same YAML setup as the core call.

#### Incremental paging call

Performs the same request with an increasing parameter while some condition is met. Often used for paging. Note that the parameter that is being increased should have `{%paramToIncrease%}` as its value if included in either the path or in the `parameters:` section.

```yaml
type: magritte-paging-inc-param-call
paramToIncrease: state key to param to increase.
checkConditionFirst: when set to "true", equivalent to a while loop. When "false" (default) equivalent to do-while loop.
initValue: Initial value of increasing parameter.
increaseBy: How much to increase the parameter by in each iteration.
onEach: List of calls to run in each iteration. Optional and used to do nested calls.
condition: Condition object that keeps requests going. As long as the condition is true,
         a new request is created. The condition is checked only after the first request,
         so this acts similarly to a do-while loop.
maxIterationsAllowed: How many iterations to run before throwing an error.
timeBetweenCalls: (optional) time to wait between requests
```

#### Incremental date call

Performs the same request with an increasing date parameter until some condition is met. Used for iterating through dates. This uses LocalDate and Period types, so the most granular increment available is one day. This only works for date-only matches. If you need to increment more granularly, see \`magritte-increasing-time-param-call\`\`.

```yaml
type: magritte-increasing-date-param-call
paramToIncrease: state key to param to increase.
checkConditionFirst: when set to "true", equivalent to a while loop. When "false" (default) equivalent to do-while loop.
initValue: Initial value of increasing parameter.
increaseBy: How much to increase the parameter by in each iteration, parseable as a java.time.Period
stopValue: The last date which will be used, including this value if applicable.
format: The format (java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter) for the DateTime parameter in each call, the same
          as initValue and stopValue.
timeBetweenCalls: (optional) time to wait between requests
```

#### Incremental time call

Performs the same request with an increasing DateTime parameter until some condition is met. Used for iterating through DateTimes.
Note, this uses OffsetDateTime and Duration types, in contrast to the magritte-incrementing-date-param-call.
OffsetDateTime does not take into account any changes with Daylight Savings Time. Make sure this will not cause unexpected gaps with how the API handles DateTimes.

```yaml
type: magritte-increasing-time-param-call
paramToIncrease: state key to param to increase.
checkConditionFirst: when set to "true", equivalent to a while loop. When "false" (default) equivalent to
                       do-while loop.
initValue: Initial value of increasing parameter.
increaseBy: How much to increase the parameter by in each iteration, parseable as a java.time.Duration
stopValue: The last DateTime which will be used, including this value if applicable.
format: The format (java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter) for the DateTime parameter in each call, the same
          as initValue and stopValue.
timeBetweenCalls: (optional) time to wait between requests
```

#### Do while

Performs a request til a specified condition is no longer met.
In addition to the core call fields, two fields should be provided.

```yaml
type: magritte-do-while-call
timeBetweenCalls: time to wait between requests
checkConditionFirst: when set to "true", equivalent to a while loop. When "false" (default) equivalent to do-while loop.
condition: Condition object that keeps requests going. As long as the condition is true,
             a new request is created.
maxIterationsAllowed: How many iterations to run before throwing an error. Defaults to 50.
```

Optionally, an initial `state` can be provided to bootstrap the first call.

For example:

```yaml
initialState:
  nextPage: ""
```

In the case where an initial `state` and an incremental `state` conflict, the incremental `state` will override the initial State.

#### Iterable state Call

Performs a request for each element in a `state` element that is iterable.

```yaml
type: magritte-iterable-state-call
timeBetweenCalls: 5s # Throttle the time between each call
iterableField: The state key to iterate over. This variable must be iterable.
iteratorExtractor: List of extractors to run on each element in the iterable.
onEach: List of calls to run in each iteration. Optional and used to do nested calls.
maxIterationsAllowed: How many iterations to run before throwing an error. Defaults to 50.
parallelism: Integer number of threads to use for the sync. Assumptions/limitations include no side effect in request,
             no guarantee as to order that calls are made or their responses update state, no time between calls.
             This field is optional and defaults to 1.
```

### Extractors

An Extractor defines how to save variables from a response or a `state` variable into the State. You can reference a variable from `state` in URL, URL parameters, or in the request body as `{%var_name_1%}`.

The default behavior of Extractors is to extract values from the Response. Optionally you can add the `fromStateVar` config to extract from the State. This allows to run different Extractors one after the other, as an example:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: csv
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    path: /my/path/index.html
    source: mysource
    method: GET
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
        assign:
          full_name: /my/field/full_name
      - type: magritte-rest-regexp-extractor
        fromStateVar: full_name
        assign:
          names: '\w+'
```

All Extractors have a condition check built-in that can be used:

```yaml
condition: Check whether the input state meets the given condition. If not, do not run the extractor.
```

#### JSON extractors

All the JSON Extractors use [Jackson JsonNode ↗](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.13/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonNode.html) and follow the same notation.

Quick guide on referencing fields:
Given the JSON `{"id":1}`:

* Using `"/id"` will return `1`
* Using `"/"` will return `{"id":1}`

Given a list, such as `[1,2,3]` or `[{"id":1},{"id":2}]`:

* Using `""` will return the list.

Wildcards may be used to reference sub-indices or fields of all items in a list. For example:

Given a field containing nested lists, such as `{ "result": [[1], [2, 3, 4]] }`:

* Using `"/result/*/0"` will return `[1,2]`.

Given a field containing a list of objects such as `{ "result": [{ "foo": 1}, {"foo": 2}]}`:

* Using `"/result/*/foo"` will return `[1,2]`.

##### Assign JSON extractor

An Extractor that simply places a field in the response into the State. The YAML setup is map of variables to save.
The left string is the name of the variable in the State, the right string is the path to the variable.

The JSON Extractor supports wildcards - given the JSON `[{"id":1}, {"id":2}]`, using `/*/id` will return \[1,2], while using "" (empty string) will return the full list.

```yaml
type: json
assign:
  var_name_1: /field-name1
  var_name_2: /field_name2
```

By default, the call will fail if the extracted field has a null value or is not present.

To prevent the call from failing in these situations, the following flags are available:

* `allowMissingField` to not fail when fields are not present or if a field has a null value.
* `allowNull` to not fail when a present field has a null value.
* `allowUnescapedControlChars` to not fail when the JSON response contains unescaped control characters such as `\n`.

```yaml
type: json
allowMissingField: true
assign:
  var_name_1: /field-name1
  var_name_2: /field_name2
```

##### Append JSON extractor

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-append-json-extractor
appendFrom: /field in response that contains an array to append from
appendFromItem: /field per array element to extract # Optional
appendTo: variable name in state to append elements to.
```

If the response looks like:

```json
{
  "things": [{"name": "dummy", "id": "1"},
             {"name": "dummy2", "id": "2"}]
}
```

then the YAML:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-append-json-extractor
appendFrom: /things
appendFromItem: /id
appendTo: var
```

would result in appending `[1,2]` to `var`.

Alternatively one could use:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-append-json-extractor
appendFrom: /things
appendTo: var
```

which would result in appending `[{"name": "dummy", "id": "1"}, {"name": "dummy", "id": "2"}]` to the `state` var.

##### Max JSON extractor

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-max-json-extractor
list: /field in response that contains an array to max over.
item: /field per array element to extract
var: state variable to save the max value to.
previousVal: state variable to get the current max value from# Optional
```

If the response looks like:

```json
{
  "things": [{"name": "dummy", "value": "1"},
             {"name": "dummy2", "value": "2"}]
}
```

then the YAML:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-max-json-extractor
list: /things
item: /id
var: max_value
```

would result in saving `2` to `max_value`.

Alternatively, assuming we already have the value `5` in `max_value` then:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-max-json-extractor
list: /things
item: /id
var: max_value
previousVal: max_value
```

would leave `max_value` equal to 5.

##### Streaming JSON last line extractor

An Extractor for the Streaming JSON (NDJSON) format where the response contains a JSON file at each line. Usually this format is used to return datasets, thus every line should have a JSON in the same format.

The Extractor supports extracting a variable from a path from the last line of the NDJSON file.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-last-streaming-json-extractor
nodePath: /id # if the json looks like {'value':'somevalue', 'id':1} this would extract the 1
varName: id # name of the variable in the state to save the value to
saveNulls: false # whether nulls should be saved to the var or skipped (default: false)
```

##### Streaming JSON append extractor

The Extractor supports extracting a variable from each line of the NDJSON file into an array as well as extracting the last encountered variable. Once the Extractor encounters a null (be it a missing line, a missing key or a null value under the key) it will stop looping.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-last-streaming-json-extractor
nodePath: /id # if the json looks like {'value':'somevalue', 'id':1} this would extract the 1
arrayVarName: ids # name of the variable in the state to save the array to
optional<lastVarName>: lastId # name of the variable in the state to save the last value of the array to
optional<limit>: 10 # limit the number of lines to parse, you can use this in addition to lastVarName and
                    # couple it with an iterableStateCall to limit the number of call per extract run
```

#### XML extractors

##### Assign XML extractor

An Extractor that simply places a field in the response into the State. The YAML setup is map of variables to save. The left string is the name of the variable in the State, the right string is the path to the variable using xpath notation.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-xml-extractor
assign:
  var_name_1: /top_level_tag/second_level_tag/text()
  var_name_2: /top_level_tag/text()
```

##### HTML extractor

Extracts from HTML by CSS selector ([supported selector syntax ↗](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/select/Selector.html)). An attribute may be specified for extraction; if left blank will return the selected Element(s)'s text. If `first` is true, the Extractor will attempt to return the first Element as a String or Number. This Extractor can also be used for ill-formed XML.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-html-extractor
var: 'links'
selector: "a[href$='pdf']"
attribute: href # Optional
first: false # Optional, defaults to false
```

The provided example will save all anchor tag hypermedia references ending in `.pdf` as an array of strings in the `links` variable.

#### String extractors

##### String extractor

Extracts a string and returns a new `state` with this string assigned to the variable defined.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
var: 'variable_name'
```

##### Substring extractor

Extracts a substring of a variable in the `state` and saves that to another state.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-substr-extractor
start: 2 # starting index of
length: 5 # Optional, length of substring (includes start index).
          # If not set, substring will be the entire string after the start index.
assign: var_to_save_substring_to
# var: state_variable_to_substring - DEPRECATED, use fromStateVar instead!
```

##### Regexp extractor

An Extractor that extract one or more regexp from a string. The yaml setup is map of variables to save. The left string is the name of the variable in the State, the right string is the regexp to match.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-regexp-extractor
assign:
  var_name_1: (1(.*)3|a(.*)c)
  var_name_2: (NotInString)
```

If the string in input is:

```
abcHelloWorld123
```

The response will look like that:

```json
{
  "var_name_1": ["abc", "123"],
  "var_name_2": []
}
```

Here is a full example of use to extract a CSV link from an HTML and then get the CSV:

```yaml
type: rest-source-adapter2
outputFileType: csv
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-rest-call
    path: /my/path/index.html
    source: mysource
    method: GET
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-regexp-extractor
        assign:
          file_paths: '(?<=https://www\.mysite\.com)(.*filename.*csv)(?=\")'
    saveResponse: false
  - type: magritte-iterable-state-call
    source: mysource
    timeBetweenCalls: 1s
    iterableField: file_paths
    method: GET
    path: '{%path%}'
    saveResponse: true
    iteratorExtractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
        var: 'path'
```

##### Regexp replace extractor

An Extractor that replaces one regexp in a string, similar to the PySpark function `pyspark.sql.functions.regexp_replace`:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-regexp-replace-extractor
var: result # `state` variable that will be created or overriden with the result string
pattern: "[a]" # regex to look for
replacement: "A" # new string to put in place of the regex matches
```

#### Array manipulation

##### Append to or extend an array

The Append Array Extractor takes in a `state` variable and pushes it to the end of an array. This Extractor is useful in collecting paths to pass to an iterable `state` call.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-append-array-extractor
appendTo: target   # If the target uninitialized, the extractor will initialize an empty array.
fromStateVar: args # Accepts either a single argument (append) or a collection (extend)
```

Here is a full example:

```yaml

type: rest-source-adapter2
restCalls:
  - type: magritte-paging-inc-param-call
    method: GET
    path: category
    paramToIncrease: page
    initValue: 0
    increaseBy: 100
    parameters:
      start_element: '{%page%}'
      num_elements: 100
    extractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-json-extractor
        assign:
          res: /response/categories
      - type: magritte-rest-append-array-extractor
        fromStateVar: res
        appendTo: categories
    until:
      type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
      var: res
  - type: magritte-iterable-state-call
    method: GET
    path: 'category/{%category%}'
    timeBetweenCalls: 5s
    iterableField: categories
    iteratorExtractor:
      - type: magritte-rest-string-extractor
        var: category
outputFileType: json
```

#### Other extractors

##### HTTP status code extractor

Extracts the HTTP status code from a response.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-http-status-code-extractor
assign: 'variable_name'
```

##### Set-Cookie response header extractor

Extracts cookies from the Set-Cookie header in a response.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-set-cookie-header-extractor
assign:
  var_name_1: cookie_name_in_set_cookie_header
```

##### Array element extractor

Extracts an element from a given array.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-array-element-extractor
fromStateVar: Array var to extract an element from.
index: The index of the element in the input array to extract.
toStateVar: Name of the variable to extract the element to.
```

The given index parameter can be negative to start at the end of the array, e.g. -1 to extract the last element.

##### Type cast extractor

An extractor that takes in a variable, casts the type of the variable using some pre-defined casting logic,
and saves the result to a destination variable.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-typecast-extractor
fromStateVar: Input variable to the extractor.
toStateVar: Output variable of the extractor.
toType: Type of the output variable after casting.
```

The `toType` parameter must be a valid Java type within the 'java.lang.' package.

Examples of valid types include 'String', 'Integer' but also the full 'java.lang' package and name: 'java.lang.Double'.

For type casting to work, there must be a pre-defined method to cast the type of the input variable to the output type.
This means that there must be code within the plugin to transform variables from and to the configured types.

Note: Casting a `java.util.Arrays` of 2 strings `a` and `b` into a String will give you `[a, b]`, whereas casting a `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode` of 2 strings `a` and `b` into a String will give you `["a","b"]` as it is the string representation of a JSON array.

### Conditions

The conditions work similar to ElasticSearch conditions. The current supported conditions are:

#### Regex

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-regex-condition
var: a state variable key
matches: a valid regular expression
```

Example:

```yaml
type: "magritte-rest-regex-condition"
var: my_state_variable
matches: '^\d+$'
```

#### Available condition

Checks if the given variable is available (whether it is assigned a non-null value).

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-available-condition
var: a state variable key
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-available-condition
var: my_state_variable
```

#### Non-empty condition

Check if the given variable is available and not empty.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
var: a state variable key
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
var: my_array_state_variable
```

#### Not condition

Negates the given sub-condition.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-not-condition
condition: A condition to negate.
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-not-condition
condition:
    type: magritte-rest-available-condition
    var: my_state_variable
```

#### And condition

Requires all the given sub-conditions to be true.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-and-condition
conditions: A list of conditions to AND over.
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-and-condition
conditions:
- type: magritte-rest-available-condition
    var: my_state_variable
- type: magritte-rest-non-empty-condition
    var: my_array-state_variable
```

#### Binary condition

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-binary-condition
toCompare:
    left: `state` key to compare on the left side of condition
    right: `state` key to compare on the right side of condition
op: One of the following "=", "<", ">", "<=", ">="
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-binary-condition
toCompare:
    left: a_state_variable
    right: another_state_variable
op: <
```

### Expressions

An expression can be used to compute certain values anywhere during a Magritte REST sync. In contrast to extractors, results of expressions are not dependent on the `state` of a sync.

#### DateTime expressions

An expression that will supply a certain date and/or time. Starts by taking the current date/time and adding the given offset(s).

Other parameters for this initial `state` variable (e.g. should be put in a top level `initialStateVars:` block):

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-datetime-expression
offset: Optional. Time to add or substract from the current date/time. Can be negative.
timezone: Optional. Which timezone to calculate the date/time for. Defaults to UTC.
formatString: Optional. Output format of the calculated date and time.
                Defaults to ISO 8601 datetime with offset.
```

For valid offsets, see [Java 8 Duration documentation ↗](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-).

For valid timezones, see [Java 8 ZoneId documentation ↗](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#of-java.lang.String-).

For valid output format strings, see [Java 8 DateTimeFormatter ↗](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html).

#### Literal expression

An expression that will provide a literal value.

The type of the literal will be automatically deduced and can be found by looking at the logs of the literal expression. Current supported types are strings, numbers, and lists.

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-literal-expression
literalValue: Required.
```

Example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-literal-expression
literalValue: 270
```

List example:

```yaml
type: magritte-rest-literal-expression
literalValue: ["it's", "a", "kind", "of", "magic"]
```

## Process JSON in Foundry

When ingesting JSON data:

```json
{
    "response": {
        "size": 1000,
        "items": [
            { "item id": 1, "status": { "modifiedAt": "2020-02-11" }, "com.palantir.metadata": { ... } },
            { "item id": 2, "status": { "modifiedAt": "2020-02-12" }, "com.palantir.metadata": { ... } },
            { "item id": 3, "status": { "modifiedAt": "2020-02-13" }, "com.palantir.metadata": { ... } }
        ]
    }
}
```

With the `magritte-rest-v2` plugin, each JSON response will be saved as a separate file in a dataset.

To easily process this data, put a schema on the raw dataset:

```
{
  "fieldSchemaList": [
    {
      "type": "STRING",
      "name": "row",
      "nullable": null,
      "userDefinedTypeClass": null,
      "customMetadata": {},
      "arraySubtype": null,
      "precision": null,
      "scale": null,
      "mapKeyType": null,
      "mapValueType": null,
      "subSchemas": null
    }
  ],
  "dataFrameReaderClass": "com.palantir.foundry.spark.input.DataSourceDataFrameReader",
  "customMetadata": {
    "format": "text",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

To clean this dataset and have each `item` as a separate row in the dataset and `item` fields as columns, create a Python transforms repository.

Add the following snippet to a new `utils/read_json.py` file:

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
import json
import re


def flattenSchema(df, dontFlattenCols=[], jsonCols=[]):
    new_cols = []
    for col in df.schema:
        _flattenSchema(col, [], new_cols, dontFlattenCols + jsonCols, jsonCols)
    print(new_cols)
    return df.select(new_cols)


def _flattenSchema(field, path, cols, dontFlattenCols, jsonCols):
    curentPath = path + [field.name]
    currentPathStr = '.'.join(curentPath)
    if field.dataType.typeName() == 'struct' and currentPathStr not in dontFlattenCols:
        for field2 in field.dataType.fields:
            _flattenSchema(field2, curentPath, cols, dontFlattenCols, jsonCols)
    else:
        fullPath = '.'.join(['`{0}`'.format(col) for col in curentPath])
        newName = '_'.join(curentPath)
        sanitized = re.sub('[ ,;{}()\n\t\\.]', '_', newName)
        if currentPathStr in jsonCols:
            cols.append(F.to_json(fullPath).alias(sanitized))
        else:
            cols.append(F.col(fullPath).alias(sanitized))


def parse_json(df, node_path, spark):
    rdd = df.dataframe().rdd.flatMap(get_json_rows(node_path))
    df = spark.read.json(rdd)
    return df


def get_json_rows(node_path):
    def _get_json_object(row):
        parsed_json = json.loads(row[0])
        node = parsed_json
        for segment in node_path:
            node = node[segment]
        return [json.dumps(x) for x in node]
    return _get_json_object
```

You can then create a Python transform with code such as the following:

```python
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output
from utils import read_json

@transform(
    output=Output("/output"),
    json_raw=Input("/raw/json_files"),
)
def my_compute_function(json_raw, output, ctx):
    df = read_json.parse_json(json_raw, ['response', 'items'], ctx.spark_session)
    df = read_json.flattenSchema(df, jsonCols=['com.palantir.metadata'])
    output.write_dataframe(df)
```

It will create a dataset:

```
item_id | status_modifiedAt | com_palantir_metadata
      1 |      "2020-02-11" | "{ ... }"
      2 |      "2020-02-12" | "{ ... }"
      3 |      "2020-02-13" | "{ ... }"
```
