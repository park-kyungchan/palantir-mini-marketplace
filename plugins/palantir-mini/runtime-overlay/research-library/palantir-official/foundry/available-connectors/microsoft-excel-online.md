# Microsoft Excel Online

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED -->

The Microsoft Excel Online connector is a [Palantir-provided driver](/docs/foundry/data-integration/foundry-provided-drivers/) connector. The official documentation for this driver can be found [here ↗](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/FXK/jdbc/pg_connectionj.htm).

## Networking

The table below lists the domains that the source needs to be able to access in order to successfully run.

If running the connection on a [Foundry worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#foundry-worker), be sure to add corresponding egress policies for each of those domains.

If those domains are in a different network from Foundry's network, and you are using [agent proxy egress policies](/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/#agent-proxy-egress-policies) (preferred) or an [agent worker](/docs/foundry/data-connection/core-concepts/#agent-worker) (not recommended), the agent must be able to reach the domain addresses. Additionally, the systems on those domains must be configured to allow connections from the agent. [Learn more about agent networking.](/docs/foundry/data-connection/set-up-agent/#configure-agent-network-access)

| Domain  | Required |
|--- |--- |
| graph.microsoft.com | If `AzureEnvironment=GLOBAL` (default) |
| login.microsoftonline.com | If `AuthScheme=AzureAD` (default), AzureServicePrincipal, AzureServicePrincipalCert AND `AzureEnvironment=GLOBAL` |
| microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn | If `AzureEnvironment=CHINA` |
| login.chinacloudapi.cn | If `AuthScheme=AzureAD` (default), AzureServicePrincipal , AzureServicePrincipalCert AND `AzureEnvironment=CHINA` |
| graph.microsoft.us | If `AzureEnvironment=USGOVT` |
| login.microsoftonline.us | If `AuthScheme=AzureAD` (default), AzureServicePrincipal, AzureServicePrincipalCert AND `AzureEnvironment=USGOVT` or USGOVTDOD |
| dod-graph.microsoft.us | If `AzureEnvironment=USGOVTDOD` |
