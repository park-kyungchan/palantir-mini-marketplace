# JupyterLab®

Code Workspaces enables you to use [JupyterLab® ↗](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in Foundry. JupyterLab® in Code Workspaces supports:

* Reading and writing tabular datasets.
* Downloading or uploading files from non-structured datasets.
* Importing Python libraries from conda or PyPI.
* Previewing Dash, Streamlit, or TensorBoard™ applications to facilitate iteration.
* Publishing Dash or Streamlit applications.
* Interacting with the Ontology.

Code Workspaces currently supports [Dash ↗](https://plotly.com/dash/) and [Streamlit ↗](https://streamlit.io/) for Python applications. Users can create applications directly in Code Workspaces with Foundry’s [version control](/docs/foundry/data-integration/branching/), [branching](/docs/foundry/data-integration/branching/), and [data governance](/docs/foundry/security/data-protection-and-governance/) features built-in.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
Code Workspace applications support branching. If you [create a new Workspace branch](/docs/foundry/code-workspaces/getting-started/#branch-your-code-workspace), publishing a new application or synchronizing the changes will publish a new version of the application on that branch. This allows you to preview your application before exposing it to your users. To publish on the master branch, simply merge your branch into master.
:::

![JupyterLab® with TensorBoard™](/docs/resources/foundry/code-workspaces/jupyterlab-with-tensor.png)

## Dash applications

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Published Dash applications are subject to a 30-second timeout, meaning that the Dash server must start up within 30 seconds of executing your Dash application Python file. Otherwise, your Dash application will fail to start up.
:::

To create a [Dash ↗](https://plotly.com/dash/) application, follow the instructions below:

1. Open the **Applications** tab in a JupyterLab® workspace.
2. Select **Publish application**, choose a location in your **Files and Projects** for your new application, and provide a module name and variable name. A file will be automatically created at the path corresponding to the provided module name.
3. *Optional:* Configure advanced settings. By default, the application settings will match the settings of the Jupyter® workspace.
4. Select **Publish and sync** to register your new Dash application and sync the code to the backing code repository. After CI checks and publishing are complete, you can select the link in the Applications panel to view the published application.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
The module name of the Dash application should be entered as a dotted path, relative to the root of the repository (for example, `app`, or if your module is inside a folder,`folder.app`). The variable name is the Python variable within the module file that is declared for the Dash app server, which is usually called `server`.
:::

To develop locally against an existing Dash application:

1. Open a terminal window and execute your newly created file, for example, `python app.py`.
2. Select **Preview** in the Dash section of the **Applications** tab to preview the application.

:::callout{theme="success"}
You can ensure the conda/PyPI environment in your JupyterLab® workspace will be automatically restored in your published Dash application using [managed conda/PyPI environments in Jupyter® Notebooks](#managed-condapypi-environments-in-jupyter-notebooks).
:::

## Streamlit applications

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Published Streamlit applications are subject to a 30-second timeout, meaning that the Streamlit server must start up within 30 seconds of executing your Streamlit application Python file. Otherwise, your published Streamlit application will fail to start up.
:::

To create a [Streamlit ↗](https://streamlit.io/) application, follow the instructions below:

1. Select **Publish application**, choose a location in your **Files and Projects** for your new application, and enter the name of your Python file relative to the root of the repository, for example, `app.py`.
2. *Optional:* Configure advanced settings. By default, the application settings will match the settings of the JupyterLab® workspace.
3. Select **Publish and sync** to register your new Streamlit application and sync the code to the backing code repository. After CI checks and publishing are complete, you can select the link in the Applications panel to view the published application.

To develop locally against an existing Streamlit application:

1. Open a terminal window and run the code with Streamlit using `streamlit run app-name.py`.
2. Open the **Applications** tab in a JupyterLab® code workspace and select **Preview** in the Streamlit section to preview the application you are developing locally.

:::callout{theme="success"}
You can ensure the conda/PyPI environment in your JupyterLab® workspace will be automatically restored in your published Streamlit application using [managed conda/PyPI environments in Jupyter® Notebooks](#managed-condapypi-environments-in-jupyter-notebooks).
:::

## TensorBoard™

You can preview [TensorBoard™ ↗](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) directly from Code Workspaces. To do this, run `tensorboard --logdir=<$PATH_TO_LOGS_DIRECTORY>` from a terminal, filling in the path to the directory containing TensorFlow logs. Then, open the Applications tab in a Jupyter® Workspace and select **Preview** in the TensorBoard™ section.

![JupyterLab® with TensorBoard™](/docs/resources/foundry/code-workspaces/jupyterlab-with-tensor.png)

## Jupyter® Notebook transforms

:::callout{theme="warning"}
Jupyter Notebook transforms currently do not support making API calls to external services, even if the network policy was added in the code workspace. To run reproducible pipelines making API calls to external systems, you should use [external transforms](/docs/foundry/data-connection/external-transforms/) instead.
:::

Code Workspaces can publish Jupyter® notebooks as data transformation pipelines and register transform JobSpecs for output datasets produced by the notebooks.

Follow the steps below to register a transform for an output dataset:

1. Save your Jupyter® notebook as a file in the workspace.

2. Select the blue **Build** icon next to the dataset in the **Data** panel.

<img src="./media/create-notebook-transform.png" alt="The blue build button to the right of the dataset name." width="500">

3. Follow the interface to configure your transform. Code Workspaces will infer the Jupyter® notebook used along with the inputs added to produce the output dataset. If the inference is wrong, you can manually edit the inputs and outputs.

<img src="./media/notebook-transform-configuration.png" alt="The Edit Transform panel with options to modify the script file, inputs, and outputs and adjust the CPU and Memory." width="300">

4. Select **Sync and run** to save the transform configuration and trigger CI checks for publishing the transform and JobSpecs on the output dataset(s).

Once CI checks are completed, your transform is ready for build. You can use other Foundry [data integration](/docs/foundry/data-integration/overview/) tools to manage your transform and the [data pipeline](/docs/foundry/data-integration/data-pipeline/) to which it belongs.

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
The transform does not automatically use the environment of the Code Workspace. You should install all the libraries needed at runtime at the top of the script file. The code snippet to install a library can be found in the **Libraries** panel.
For example, to use `scikit-learn` and `scikit-image` in your transform, add this code snippet to the top of the file:

```bash
!mamba install -y -q scikit-learn scikit-image
```
:::

## Managed conda/PyPI environments in Jupyter® Notebooks

Jupyter® conda/PyPI environments can be consistently restored across Jupyter® workspaces, applications, transforms, and model outputs, using the managed environment feature backed by Maestro. Maestro is a Foundry library management tool that lets you install and manage libraries for Jupyter workspaces. It integrates with conda and pip, making library installation easier and helping maintain consistent environments. To convert commands to Maestro, refer to the instructions below for either [conda](#manage-conda-libraries-with-maestro) or [PyPI](#manage-pypi-libraries-with-maestro).

Managed environments are consistent across Code Workspace workflows, eliminating the need to re-run the same `mamba` and `pip` commands every time you restart your workspace, start an application, or run a Jupyter® Notebook transform. With a managed environment, installed libraries in your working environment are tracked through files in your `/home/user/repo` folder, allowing the environment to be restored to its original state across workflows.

The following two files are used to track your managed environment:

1. `/home/user/repo/.envs/maestro/meta.yaml`: Known as the environment **manifest**, it contains the set of **requested** libraries and versions for your environment. [Learn more about the meta.yaml file](#example-metayaml-file).
2. `/home/user/repo/.envs/maestro/hawk.lock` - Known as the environment **lock file**, it contains the set of **resolved** libraries and versions for your environment, solved from the constraints specified in the manifest. The `hawk.lock` file replaces `conda.lock`, which has been deprecated. [Learn more about the `hawk.lock` file](#example-hawklock-file).

:::callout{theme="warning"}
We do not recommend modifying the `hawk.lock` lock file. Instead, rely on installation commands to update the files on your behalf. Unless there is a git conflict, you do not need to modify the `meta.yaml` file either; it will automatically update when libraries are interactively installed.
:::

Your managed environment is installed in your `/home/user/envs/default` folder. This environment is restored before the following stages:

* Starting up your Jupyter® workspace
* Starting up applications produced from your workspace
* Running Jupyter® Notebook transforms produced from your workspace
* Running models

### Usage

#### 1. Enable managed environments

To enable this feature, toggle the `Managed Conda environments` advanced feature in your workspace settings, located on the left sidebar. Then, restart the workspace:

<img src="./media/managed-conda-toggle-advanced.png" alt="Dialogue for the managed conda environments advanced feature" width="500">

Once the feature is enabled, a managed environment named `default` will be available for you to use:

<img src="./media/managed-default-environment.png" alt="Notebook file launchers using managed environment with name default" width="500">

#### 2. Update your managed environment

Follow the steps below to update your managed environment and manage libraries.

##### Manage conda libraries with Maestro

* **Install using the Libraries panel:** Search for the library name (for example, `numpy`) and install.

* **Install using the terminal:** To install the latest version of a library, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  maestro env conda install <library_name>
  ```

  To install a specific version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  maestro env conda install <library_name>==<library_version>
  ```

* **Uninstall using the terminal:** To uninstall a library, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  maestro env uninstall --conda-dependencies <library_names>
  ```

##### Manage PyPI libraries with Maestro

* **Install using the Libraries panel:** Search for the library name (for example, `numpy`) and install.

* **Install using the terminal:** To install the latest version of a library, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  maestro env pip install <library_name>
  ```

  To install a specific version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  maestro env pip install <library_name>==<library_version>
  ```

* **Uninstall using the terminal:** To uninstall a library, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  maestro env uninstall --pip-dependencies <library_names>
  ```

:::callout{theme="warning"}
When installing a library through the **Libraries** tab, the install command is executed directly in the Jupyter® terminal, rather than executing it within your notebook or application code. Every time an install command is run, the `meta.yaml` manifest will be updated with your requested library, and the `hawk.lock` file will reflect the libraries installed in the current environment.
:::

#### 3. View currently installed libraries in your managed environment

Installed libraries are visible in the **Libraries** tab:

<img src="./media/installed-libraries-tab.png" alt="List of installed libraries displayed in the Libraries tab" width="500">

#### 4. View environment files in the JupyterLab® interface

Navigate to the **View** dropdown menu in the workspace and select **Show Hidden Files**.

<img src="./media/managed-conda-show-hidden-file.png" alt="Dropdown menu in Jupyter interface to show hidden files" width="500">

Then, navigate to the `.envs/maestro` folder to view the `meta.yaml` and `hawk.lock` files.

#### 5. Synchronize your managed environment with changes to the `hawk.lock` file

After checking out a new branch or pulling new git changes, the contents of your hawk.lock file may change.

To synchronize your managed environment, execute the following command in your workspace terminal:

```bash
maestro env install
```

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
`maestro` is the command line interface that updates managed environments. The above command re-resolves the lock file from the manifest and installs the environment into the `/home/user/envs/default` folder.
:::

#### 6. Resolve git conflicts to your environment files

To resolve git conflicts in your managed environment, first delete the `hawk.lock` file. Navigate to the `meta.yaml` file to resolve any conflicts, then merge your branch.

After merging, run the `maestro env install` command in your terminal to regenerate the `hawk.lock` file and reinstall your managed environment.

#### 7. Upgrade your managed environment

To update your managed environment, first remove the `hawk.lock` file. Then, delete your `/home/user/envs/default` folder (`rm -rf /home/user/envs/default`). Finally, run the `maestro env install` command in your terminal to regenerate your `hawk.lock` file. Your environment will be re-installed with upgraded library versions.

##### Example: `meta.yaml` file

The `meta.yaml` file represents a specification of requested libraries. This file conforms to the [Conda metadata specification ↗](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html), and can contain specifications for both conda and PyPI dependencies. Only libraries specified in the `requirements.run` and `requirements.pip` section are used for Jupyter® managed environments.

Below is an example of a `meta.yaml` file:

```yaml
package:
  name: '{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}'
  version: '{{ PACKAGE_VERSION }}'
requirements:
  build: []
  run:
    - ipykernel
    - pip
    - foundry-transforms-lib-python
    - pandas
    - polars
    - dash
    - streamlit
    - tensorboard
  pip:
    - Flask-Testing
  run_constrained: []
source:
  path: ../src
build: null
test: null
about: null

```

##### Example: `hawk.lock` file

The `hawk.lock` file contains the resolved libraries, versions, and channels of a solved managed environment.

Below is an example of a `hawk.lock` file:

```
# This file is autogenerated. Though not necessary, it can be committed to the git repository.
# To avoid build failures, we do not recommend changing this file,
